Fit Explanation: The user is actively seeking clarification and assistance regarding their denial, indicating a very good fit for appeal help.
Original Post: Kaiser recently denied my purchase of a health insurance plan citing that I “voluntarily quit my previous plan”.  I quit my job, not my health insurance plan. That employer decided, as most (but not all) do, to cease their employer contribution to my plan and cancel it. That is inherently the QLE. 

Numerous sources confirm this is considered a QLE, even other health insurance companies. 

Why is Kaiser able to skirt around offering coverage and a SEP for such a common occurrence?
