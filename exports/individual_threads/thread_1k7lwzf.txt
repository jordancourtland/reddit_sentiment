Original Post: Hello - I have a question about denial codes in EOBs.

I have a primary insurance that only covers work in CA and a secondary that only covers work in MD. Long story short: I learned the hard way that I need to include my primary even when I know they'll deny everything in MD.

The coordination of benefits between both insurances has been lacking and my secondary has only gone and unpaid some of the claims they originally paid last year. I made a mistake waiting around for them to correct the rest and the six month claim process + one year appeal timeline have both lapsed. (In some cases, the doctors had both of my insurances but never went back and reprocessed claims that went through my secondary first so maybe I have an argument there that they didn't fulfill their obligation to bill the insurances correctly/timely).

My problem is now this: my primary insurance is going to deny everything with the reason of timely filing. I always expected denials from them, but under the justification that these out of state services are not covered by this plan. The latter reason has earned claim approvals from my secondary but I'm thinking the "timely filing" reason means my secondary will outright deny as well.

Is there any way to get my primary insurance to deny based on the service coverage as opposed to (or maybe in addition to) the timely filing? I can't get a straight answer from them. For example, I have two claims processed on the same day by my primary. One has the "timely filing" reason for denial and the other has "timely filing" in addition to "services not covered by plan." They aren't able to explain to me why the second claim doesn't have that coverage reason code.

Is there any reasoning with them on this? It seems like the difference between my secondary's approval or denial. Sorry for the long read and thank you!
