Subreddit: medicalbill
Created: 1715881373
Persona Fit: 0.8
Confidence: 0.7
Denial Type: Unknown
Outcome: Unclear
OP Summary: The original poster is seeking advice on how to handle a new bill from a medical provider after their insurance denied a claim without notification, and they are unsure whether to dispute with the provider or the insurer.
Responses Summary: Commenters advised contacting the insurance company first to understand the denial reason and to request a breakdown of the explanation of benefits (EOB), as the issue may stem from an error by the insurance or the provider's billing department.
Themes: insurance claim reprocessing, communication with insurer, billing errors
Options Suggested: contact insurance company, request EOB breakdown, dispute with provider
Fit Explanation: The original poster is currently dealing with a denial situation and is actively seeking guidance on how to proceed, indicating a very good fit for assistance.
Original Post: Date of service was 8/31/22. We received a bill with “Adjustments” on 12/7/22. We paid the balance on 1/3/23. 

On 3/4/23, our insurance made a note that the claim was denied.  We never received notification of this. We only discovered this after we received the bill discuses below. 

On 4/13/24, more than 15 months after payment, we received a new bill asking for the majority of the bill to be paid out of pocket. The adjustment amount was significantly lower on this bill. This bill acknowledges our last payment. 

Has anyone had this happen? Not sure if I should go directly to the provider to dispute or go to my insurer. 

Thanks for your help.
