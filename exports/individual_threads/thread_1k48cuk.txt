Original Post: Hi! Really appreciate any help anyone can offer. TLDR is – **can I file for the premium tax credit when I file for 2025, even if I wasn't offered the credit when signing up for Marketplace?**

I filled out an application in January when checking if it'd be cheaper to go through Marketplace or my employer. It was cheaper through employer. Last month, I quit my old job and lost coverage. My new job doesn't offer coverage. I was able to resubmit my application with the qualifying life event (though I don't recall it asking me specifically what happened) and I put my income at $38k – single 27 y/o, no dependents. Got denied the premium tax credit and realizing now my income will be more like $32k. According to this estimator, I should qualify either way...https://www.irs.gov/help/ita/am-i-eligible-to-claim-the-premium-tax-credit

I know there is the Advance Premium Tax Credit and regular – does anyone know if I can file for the premium tax credit when I file for 2025 and hopefully get a few grand back?!

Thank you!
