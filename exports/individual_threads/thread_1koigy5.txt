Original Post: I’m a nurse. My docs are in-network, but at other facilities for privacy reasons (and because they’re fantastic).

I’m having a bilateral salpingectomy soon and just got a letter back from UHC stating that they wouldn’t cover the bil salp at in-network cost since I could have it done at my hospital. It went on to say that there is coverage for in and out of network services, but no coverage for out of network preventive services. I have had procedures done before with my in-network docs at this facility without issue (cost is slightly higher, but still have coverage). 

I knew I’d have to pay a little extra, but I wasn’t expecting 100% denial. I’m already planning to call UHC and have a backup plan to negotiate the bill with the facility if it comes to that.. but guess it may be a loophole where they can deny it completely though :(
