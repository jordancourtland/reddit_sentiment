Fit Explanation: The original poster is currently dealing with a denial and is seeking advice on how to proceed, indicating a very good fit for assistance.
Original Post: Received a huge bill for an emergency room visit after an auto accident last year. I have been using my regular healthcare provider for auto insurance PIP coverage as it is a qualified healthcare plan. Now the auto insurance denied the ER visit claim which I think is understandable but healthcare insurance also denying the claim saying that they are only secondary to auto insurance. Am I responsible for the ER bill or I am missing something?
