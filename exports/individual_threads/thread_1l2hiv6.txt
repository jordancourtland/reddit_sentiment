Original Post: My son (dependent) is seeing a therapist. The office the therapist works for is in-network, but I was told the therapist my son is seeing was out-of-network. That was fine with me. I’ve often submitted out-of-network behavior health claims from other providers to my insurance with no problem getting partial reimbursement.

However, this time my claims were denied due to “provider is not credentialed.” 

I contacted my insurance company and all I get is “he’s not credentialed so it’s denied.” And when I contact the therapist’s office all I get is “yes, he’s out of network, it has nothing to do with his credentials.”  We have gone back and forth with no success. (I checked and he is up to date with all his licensing, etc)

I’m looking for someone to explain this to me if possible. Am I missing something, what am I not understanding?
