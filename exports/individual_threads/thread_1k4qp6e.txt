Original Post: From June to December of last year, I had marketplace insurance through Florida Blue. I called in December to report my income, and once they quoted me over $400, I told them not to proceed with the renewal. I also put in a request online and avoided paying the premium so they can cancel it. But I still had coverage through March, so I called again and told them that my employer insurance started on January 1st, and the furthest back they canceled it was 1/31/25. They even sent it to be appealed, and my request was denied. This means I will be penalized again next year for the month of January when I do my taxes. Has anyone else dealt with this issue? Would I have to take legal action at this point?
