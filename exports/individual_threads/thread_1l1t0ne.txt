Original Post: Hello Everyone,  
I’ve seen a bunch of posts here about denied claims and wanted to throw in something that worked for me, in case it helps someone else digging through the same mess. I had a procedure earlier this year that I thought was covered, prior auth was submitted, doctor said we were good. Then the denial came in: “not medically necessary.” The EOB made zero sense, and after a couple of useless calls with the insurer, I figured I’d try appealing. The problem is, most of the “sample letters” I found online were either outdated or super vague. I did find one tool from a non profit organization called Counterforce Health that walked me through creating a custom letter. I sent that off and just heard back, they overturned the denial. Didn’t expect it to actually work, to be honest. It was free and pretty straightforward. This stuff sucks. Hope it helps at least one other person here not get steamrolled.
