Original Post: We have just discovered we have a genetic disease in our family. We have all been advised to get tested. My main concern is for my son who is aging off our insurance in 2 months. my first thought was to hurry and get him tested before he loses coverage. If he tests positive he would need an MRI and CT scans. If he tests now and is positive, will he have trouble getting insurance later because he will now be saddled with a pre existing condition? Should he wait to be tested until he’s secured new insurance? He may be getting married this summer and would go on his wife’s insurance. If he has this disease would her rates go sky high or could they deny him coverage under her insurance?
