Original Post: Hi, there!

I'm noticing that quite a few of several different providers' claims are being processed as a "facility charge" (these are outpatient doc visits) and are being denied for that reason. I've never had this issue with previous insurance carriers. I'm then getting billed by the providers for the full amounts of the visits because insurance didn't pay anything. I'm assuming this is a coding error that the providers need to resolve, but seems odd to have it happen multiple times with different, unrelated providers. 

Anyone have any insight?
