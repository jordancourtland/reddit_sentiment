Original Post: Hi everyone, sorry for the rant. I'm dealing with a difficult situation with my health insurance and could use some guidance. BCBS has denied my claim for emergency back surgery ($60,000) that I underwent in November. Here's what happened:

I had to have surgery within 24 hours of seeing a neurologist due to a herniated disc crushing my sciatic nerve. The urgency was due to trying to prevent permanent nerve damage to my foot - I couldn't even walk at that point. There was absolutely no time to get pre-authorization.

After the surgery, UNC Health didn't request post-procedure authorization from my insurance. Instead, they just sent a bill without including information about the medical necessity, resulting in the claim being denied. We're now on the third appeal, and despite additional information being sent, it's not looking promising.

Interestingly, I needed a second, more invasive discectomy just two weeks after the first procedure. In that case, UNC immediately sent in a request for authorization after the surgery, and Blue Cross covered it without any issues.

I believe UNC Health may be at fault for not requesting authorization in a timely manner for my first surgery. I've already involved my employer and their BCBS representative, but they said there was nothing they could do after looking into it.

I'm expecting this third appeal to be denied as well. What should my next steps be? Has anyone dealt with a similar situation? Any advice would be greatly appreciated.
