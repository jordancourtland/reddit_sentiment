Original Post: I have an issue with my health insurance provider denying a claim for my child's video EEG.
 
April, 2024: My child, has a video EEG due to frequent headaches.
 
August, 2024: Claim was denied by my health insurance provider.
 
November, 2024: Insurance denied the appeal filed by the doctor's office.
 
I'd like to request an external review but I want to make sure I put forth the best argument I can.
 
This is what I see on the denial letter from the insurance company:
 
"The member had a test for brain waves (an EEG).  This test was done with video recording.  A video test is needed for seizures when:
 
1. A routine test for brain waves has an unclear result. OR
2. The treatment plan may include surgery. OR
3. A seizure medication has been stopped, and changes in medication may be needed.
 
The records sent do not state that one of these requirements has been met.  We did not receive the report for a recent routine test.  Therefore, this test was not medically necessary"
 
My child stopped gabapentin and lyrica just prior to the EEG which should satisfy requirement number 3 above.
 
I have a letter from a nurse explaining why it was medically necessary.
 
I also plan to include a letter I write explaining the entire situation in normal terms from my perspective.
 
I will also include the doctors notes indicating the stopping of gabapentin and lyrica.
 
Does anyone have any advice or suggestions that would help maximize my chances of getting this approved?
 
The amount billed to insurance is just under $10,000 so this is a big issue for us.
 
Thank you for any and all advice!
