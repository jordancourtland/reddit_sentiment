Original Post: Cigna denied coverage for breast ultrasound in Vermont, however Vermont law 8 V.S.A. ยง 4100a requires insurance coverage for breast cancer screening by ultrasound: 

"(a) Insurers shall provide coverage for screening by mammography for the presence of breast cancer. In addition, insurers shall provide coverage for screening by ultrasound for a patient for whom the results of a screening mammogram were inconclusive or who has dense breast tissue, or both. Benefits provided shall cover the full cost of the mammography service or ultrasound, as applicable, and shall not be subject to any co-payment, deductible, coinsurance, or other cost-sharing requirement or additional charge."

Filed an appeal with Cigna over the phone but am now finding out the representative only submitted the claim for adjustment.  What are my options to push this through/lean no Cigna?
