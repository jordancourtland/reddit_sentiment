Original Post: I just received a letter in the mail that united insurance denied our claim for the hospital stay. I am furious.  The letter says essentially that the hospital stay was not medically necessary and I'm looking for opinions &amp; advice on the best way to appeal this. 

On Monday daycare called and said our 6MO was inconsolable and had a fever only an hour after dropping him off. His arms and face were severely swollen and red.  When we picked him up, we could not get a sick appointment so we went to the local childrens hospital (we also feared it could be an allergic reaction to something). The ER doctor said they believed it to be an infection and allergic reaction and discharged us with a follow up appointment with an allergy specialist. 

The next day He had a steady fever of 101-102.  His arms and face were more swollen and started to Blister and puss as if it was a burn, so we took him to the pediatritian. They had 4 doctors come and take a look and couldn't figure it out. They called to another local ER to make sure we could get him in so we took him there. 

The ER doctor said it was an infection and took blood and skin samples for a culture and said we needed to admit him and start antibiotics immediately.

For 48 hours, it was hard to control his fever and to make matters worse, the blood culture pointed to a blood infection. So they started with another antibiotic.

On Thursday, he started to show signs of improvements with his fever and swelling of the arms and face. The arms looks absolutely disgusting as if he had terrible burns from the bistering and pus of the infection. They took one more blood sample to culture. 

On Friday he was great and the second culture came back that there was no blood infection. The doctors said that the first one could have been a contaminant from the sample, but non the less I'm so happy he wasn't sepsis.  They discharged him that evening. 

With the claim being denied, I feel like went by all our the medical professions opinion and did the right thing.  He was incredibly sick for a few days and we went by the doctors 'orders'. 

When we appeal, whT are the changes to get this overturned? what is the best way to help our case?  Should we get photos, letters from doctors? Would it help to get a lawyer to help us with this?  

Thank you in advance for all opinions/shared experience.
