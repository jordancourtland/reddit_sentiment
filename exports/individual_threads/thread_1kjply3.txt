Original Post: So at the end of October I severely broke my arm, and had a plate put in holding it together. My surgeon wants to get the plate removed asap because it’s impeding movement in my shoulder. Early April, I had some xrays, and the surgeon said the bone hasn’t healed enough to remove the plate and referred me for a bone stimulator device. I was contacted by the Bone Stimulator company guy and told that he was just waiting on insurance approval. A couple weeks later he calls me and says insurance has approved it, I get the device and start using it. This week I got a letter in the mail saying I was denied coverage because it had been over 6 months since my surgery (it had been less than 6 months when I was referred but by the time I got it it had been more than 6 months) Contacted the bone stimulator guy and he said he’s in the process of appealing the decision.
So my question: If my insurance denies the appeal and refuses to pay for the device, what then? I was specifically told how much I would pay after insurance and I wouldn’t have agreed to get the device if I was going to be paying out of pocket. Will I be expected to pay for this crazy expensive medical device out of pocket?
