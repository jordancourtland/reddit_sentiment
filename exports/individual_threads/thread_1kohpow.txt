Original Post: So due to health issues, a doctor ordered a Cervical MRI, and a Brain MRI with and without contrast. The place I went to, I scheduled the appointment and provided insurance info etc, and a few days before my appointment they called and told me that after insurance, my total was $329.29. I thought that was pretty freaking cheap, but okay. Why would they lie? Right? Well the claims just hit my insurance and it’s been denied, and it appears I owe $5200+ to the MRI company. What do I do? I don’t think I have proof that they told me what the cost after insurance would be, though I do have a receipt with the total. Other tests have been rescheduled or canceled because insurance denied it, so I was under the impression, both because of this and because they said ‘after insurance this is your total’, that the office got prior approval. Where do I go from here?

Adding: not asking for medical advice. Just asking for health insurance advice
