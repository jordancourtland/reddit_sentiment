Original Post: Hello, I wanting to see if anyone has had a similar experience that could give me ideas on what my next steps should be. Any help is appreciated.

My wife was pregnant last year and gave birth in February of this year. We bad BCBS basic and opted to switch to MHBP standard during last year’s open season. According to the info on MHBP, Maternity was supposed to be 100% covered. After giving birth, we are getting billed about 5600 for the delivery after insurance coverage. After talking to the doctors office, they informed us the previous insurance (BCBS) has already paid their share of the bill and what’s left should be paid by the new insurance (MHBP). I called MHBP and they told me they are pro rating the amount they paid based on the time she was under coverage and the rest should be paid by the previous insurance. After arguing back and forth they told me they would investigate and give a decision in 45 days. After 2 months they came back saying the same thing. Not sure where I would go from here?
