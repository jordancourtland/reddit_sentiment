Original Post: Around 05/04/24 I went to ER because I felt like I was dying from the pain of my stomach which later on I found out that my appendix was close to ruptured so I needed surgery to remove the appendix. After surgery I needed to stay in hospital up to 5/10/24, I think it’s was because of how bad shape I was. I am freaking out because I never got this notice. I searched up to see if the hospital I went to “is network with Fidelis (Medicaid)” and they are.

Edit: This ER visit was when I was still 18 years old
