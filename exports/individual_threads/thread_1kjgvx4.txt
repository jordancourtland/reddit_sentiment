Original Post: My experience with Humana is that they are scum sucking leeches that that advantage of elderly folks, sell them an insurance that they don't need, then deny services for the policy holder.  
Here's my current situation.   My uncle is 80 yrs old.  Fell...broke his arm....went to hospital.   They set his arm, but referred him to a occupation therapist in a nursing home for therapy.  Mind you, he has also been paying for Medicare A and B (premiums being deducted from his SS check each month.).  Humana decides that his coverage for therapy is ending.  That's OK.    Right?  We still have Medicare.   Nooooo,  Humana is a "replacement " insurance so Medicare will not pick up or cover ANYTHING going forward.  
It gets better.  The nursing home won't release him.  He doesn't have insurance now, and is incurring $380 per day from the nursing home.  If we elect to remove him it is considered an "AMA" (against medical advisement), in which case he can never be approved to stay at a nursing home again, and Hunana has the right to not pay past medical bills/services.

Have you ever heard of such nonsense?
