Original Post: I know this is likely due to the in vs. out of network piece here...But I was reviewing our EOBs for CPT 99214 and CPT 99213 and found some very interesting information and now...I want to decide how to proceed with this appeal.  
  
Again read above, yes, possibly associated with in vs. out-of-network - but wouldn't you think the average contracted amount for a CPT code would be appropriate? 

***So they allow $229.44 for CPT 99213 in the agreed upon amount for in-network, yet they think allowing less than $150 for a higher level claim is appropriate just because it's out of network?*** 

I know - again this is likely related to contracts.  But there is a reason some medical professionals don't go through the insurance process.  I'm not here to debate the contracts, but this feels off.  

|Code|In or out of network provider?|Amt Billed|Not payable|In-network allowed|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|CPT 99214 |Out of network|200|48.78|\--|
|CPT 99214|Out of network (diff provider - for my spouse)|150|\--|\--|
|CPT 99213|in network (lower level claim)|237.00|\--|229.44|
|CPT 99213 (when Aetna downcoded the above 99214 that I appealed and won...)|Out of network|200|92.48|\--|
