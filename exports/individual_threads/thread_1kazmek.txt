Original Post: Hoping someone can offer insight. I am a Federal Retiree with Standard GEHA coverage. It is my only coverage.

I have outstanding claims &gt; 90 days that GEHA denied, stating a Medicare EOB was needed. I have called 4 times,  advising them I don't have Medicare, each time receiving assurance that claims would reprocess. Still no action.

We have faxed and mailed written appeals as well, but no evidence or acknowledgment of receipt or action on that front either.

GEHA is administered by UHC. Anyone with advice on how to escalate this? 

TIA
