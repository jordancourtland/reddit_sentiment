Original Post: Hi all,
I really need help or guidance here. Our newborn had to spend some time in the NICU, and we just received a bill from the hospital for around $150,000, which they “generously” reduced to $38,000 after some discount. But the nightmare is just starting.

The hospital says our insurance denied the claim, and when I called the insurance company, they said they requested medical records from the hospital but never received them. Because of that, they denied the claim.

I asked the insurance company if they could follow up with the hospital. They said they already sent a letter and that there’s nothing else they can do.

When I call the hospital billing department, they claim they never got any letter and straight-up refuse to call the insurance or help move this forward. I’ve asked multiple times, and they just don’t care. They keep repeating that I’m responsible for the balance.

Now I’m stuck in the middle, with each side blaming the other and no one willing to talk to each other. And I obviously can’t afford a $38,000 bill.

Has anyone dealt with something like this? How do I get this resolved when neither party will take initiative?

Any advice, tips, or next steps would be greatly appreciated.
