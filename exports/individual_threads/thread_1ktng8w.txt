Original Post: I purchased eyeglasses for my child out of pocket at a retailer/optometrist office that is in network for my Cigna medical plan. I see this provider and get my exams covered through insurance, however, this is not where we got the RX written for my child - just their glasses.

We discussed insurance, but I confirmed I did not have vision specific insurance/only medical and so they did not submit any claims to Cigna. 200 days later, it turns out my medical plan covers 1 pair of lenses/frames for child dependents per annual year and did so at the time of purchase. 

The provider said they would not submit this claim on my behalf as it's been too long. I'm wavering between owning 100% of this as my error versus thinking that the provider/retailer - who already had my insurance on file - should have confirmed coverage. In fact, shortly after this episode they submitted my personal contact lenses to my Cigna plan, which of course was denied.

I plan to submit a claim regardless with low expectations that Cigna will cover this.

Any feedback on course of action or otherwise? Thanks!

edit: I'm in Vermont. I should also add that out of network self submission claims have an 180 day timeframe to submit in my plan; however the plan makes no mention of in-network self submissions, given that the provider is to handle these.
