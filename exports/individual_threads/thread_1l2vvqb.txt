Original Post: Hi! 

Feeling overwhelmed at both the thought of my situation and making sure I can put every important detail here lol. 

ALRIGHT, SO. 

I was employed by/insured thru a company from 2017-2020. It was BCBS of IL if this holds any relevance. I quit in early 2020, February or March-ish. In May I found out I was pregnant &amp; applied for Medicaid as I had been told my insurance would be termed 30 days after my last day of employment. No biggie. 

Halfway thru my pregnancy, my OB started telling me they needed my primary insurance info as Medicaid was claiming they were my secondary. Turns out, my company had never fully termed my insurance? I never got a clear explanation here just an email confirmation that it HAD been closed/cancelled/termed with a date. 

Now to throw yall for a loop, I got married and added to Tricare insurance in October 2020. Tricare and Medicaid split the coverage and I never heard a peep about stupid BCBS again. 

UNTILLLLLLLL I called my PCP for an appointment earlier this year and the lovely lady helping book my appointment said, “Hey, has anyone told you Tricare isn’t paying your claims?” Skkkrrrrrtttttt. No?? 

I was not registered for notifications via mail and the email they were sending them to is mainly used for spam unfortunately. I’m a millennial, okay? Sue me. 

So anyway, I call Tricare like, “Hey, mfs. What is happening?” They tell me they STILL SHOW ME WITH A BCBS POLICY. 

-_- 

So I contact BCBS who tells me they have multiple claims for me spanning from 2020-2024. I was employed by this company once more from 2021-2022 but didn’t use their insurance as I was under the impression I was using Tricare. BCBS was able to give me end dates to all of the policies which I then conveyed to Tricare. 

I still have an abundance of denied/unpaid claims. What is the time frame something like this should take to resolve? Who is at fault? And wtf should I do to get this process sped up so I can go to the DOCTOR!! 

If you read all of this, tysm. I hope you have advice lol.
