Original Post: Hello, I am unsure how this issue has came up but i’m under the impression there has been a mistake. I have been approved since 10-2024 for pregnant medicaid coverage, in december i received request for employment information / landlord verification (for pregnant coverage to continue to be eligible) I turned in the information requested in time. Then a few weeks later i received a renewal package for my daughters coverage. now in march 03-2025 i received a denial of coverage letter for both my daughter and myself listing a combination of forms requested. I did not return that renewal package and now they are saying that’s the reason my pregnant medicaid coverage is being denied. I’m frustrated and worried because i’m now 31 weeks pregnant and they have caused a huge problem. anyone have any insight on how this works? thanks 

UPDATE: this issue was resolved 🙌🏼
