Original Post: I stupidly purchased HMO insurance  without realizing and had a $4k test. Insurance denied it because it was out of network and the hospital won't give me a self pay discount since I have insurance. I'm on the hook for the entire amount and it doesn't even go towards out of pocket max. Is this legal? Does this happen often?

Edit: thanks for all the replies. I've learned a lot, but particularly that I was very ignorant when it comes to insurance stuff. I should've done more dd before choosing a plan.
