Original Post: While I don’t have an official diagnosis, last time I went to get glasses the optometrist gave me a referral to another doctor and said that it was pretty clear I have one. Since I don’t have any health insurance, I decided I’d just wait until it gets really bad before I do something about it. 

That was a year ago and now I’ve been messing up at work cause I can’t read anything. 

So TECHNICALLY speaking, I have no preexisting conditions. I am a 22 year old male in Florida on a 3.5k a month salary. 

Would it be wise for me to get health (and or vision) insurance and then make an appointment to get diagnosed so I can be referred to a surgeon? And if so what insurer should I go with, who won’t deny coverage on cataract surgery?

What are my next steps?

EDIT: Clarity
