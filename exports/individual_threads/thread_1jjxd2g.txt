Original Post: I completed a lab at an INN provider office. The lab (billing provider) is OON. Insurance is denying the lab claim due to OON (HMO, no OON coverage). I have been in communication with them about this. At first, the response was "Rendering provider is not linked with billing provider" and requested INN list the NETWORK name: XXXXXX, If INN list the CONTRACT name: XXXXXX, and If INN list the effective date: XX/XX/XXXX for processing. I followed up for clarification but did not get far, so I plan to follow up. 

I am not understanding the basics of this. Is a rendering provider linked to a billing provider via a contract?

Another question: I had a similar issue with a dermatologist's office and talked with someone in claims with the insurance company who said something like, "So what you are saying is you were not given a choice of providers?" I responded, "yes," and they did some sort of exception and got it processed INN.  Are there known exceptions to this situation?

  
This is not covered under the No Surprises Act since it was not a hospital or ambulatory surgical center.
