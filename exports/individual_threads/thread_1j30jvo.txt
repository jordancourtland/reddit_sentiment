Original Post: So my graduate program consisted of a masters and then a specific certification. This semester I only needed to take 1 additional course (3 cr) for the certification. I paid the initial health insurance fee, but it looks like once I dropped to 3cr they removed it.

Turns out I don’t qualify for coverage now (it ended when I graduated from the masters in December). 

So I’ve essentially gone 2 months without health insurance inadvertently and have no idea what to do?

I start a new job next week with insurance but then it takes a month for a waiting period.

Anyway I learned this as I went to pick up a prescription and they denied it for lack of coverage.

Anyway I hate the US insurance scheme- it seems like you need a lawyer just to protect yourself. I have no idea what to do?
