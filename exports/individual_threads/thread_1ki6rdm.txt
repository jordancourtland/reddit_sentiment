Original Post: Hi everybody,

Insurance is pissing me off, I can’t take this. I won’t get too deep in my story but I got denied 3x for an MRI that was necessary to show my spine prognosis (I literally couldn’t walk) but “it wasn’t urgent”. Screw that. I’m all good now but I would love to hear your stories on getting denied for whatever reason.

If you know why you were denied / if the doctor supported you but insurance was being dumb etc.

Sorry this isn’t well worded I’m in a rush but please share your stories. As deep as you feel comfortable or even the outrageous price you had to pay vs itemized bill.
