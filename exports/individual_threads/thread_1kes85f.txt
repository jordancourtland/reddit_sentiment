Original Post: I speak with a behavioral therapist through bi-weekly phone calls. The service provider is out-of-network (she was originally in-network but updated which plans were in-network and my plan fell off that list). My plan offers 70% reimbursement for out-of-network mental health services, so my understainding was that I can submit my receipts and they would apply towards my out-of-network deductible. I realized on the receipts she provides, she lists the services as telehealth and therefore my claims are now being denied (no coverage for out-of-network telehealth). Does anyone have a similar experience and solutions to help rectify this? I can't understand why simply getting the services over the phone would disqualify insurance coverage, specifically for behavioral therapy.
