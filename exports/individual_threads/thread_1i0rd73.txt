Original Post: I have had accident insurance for many years as I have 2 active daughters in multiple sports. The insurance company is trying to say that my daughter, who dislocated her shoulder at All Star cheer practice  was not a result of an accident because the medical records don’t “explicitly” state that she fell or was hit in our initial visit notes.  

Summation, she was performing a stunt (in All Star Cheer), contacted the ground and her shoulder popped out.  We saw the doctor the next day who ordered an x-ray and MRI which confirmed the dislocation.

I filed my claim  with Prudertial which was denied stating they do not cover “hyperextension”.   I filed my first appeal citing the exact spot in the medical records that confirmed the “dislocation” NOT a hypertension. 

They denied my appeal stating that  they now recognize the dislocation but the injury was not a result of their definition of an accident.  I asked how else would the dislocation happen if not accidental, they informed it could be “wear and tear” and “some people’s shoulders pop out on their own.”  

I filed a second appeal with an addendum to the medical records to state that her injury was not a result of any prior condition or hyper mobility but was an acute injury- this seems to still not be enough for the insurance company.   If she has no prior conditions, and they are deeming this not an accidental injury, does that imply that my daughter purposely popped her shoulder out of socket.  It’s just really ridiculous that because it doesn’t state that she was “hit” that it’s not an accidental injury.   

As of 845am on 1/9/2025, the claim was partially approved (so I thought I had made some progress, NOPE…keep reading) with only the “Organized Sports Benefit” decision still in Pending. I spoke to a representative for almost an hour going down what was approved what wasn’t, and what was still needed for the Organized Sports Benefit. They provided me the full Contract with my company via email.  He informed that I would be paid via my bank account on file and that payment will be finalized shortly.   In parallel, he recommend I get the email from the coach detailing the accident happened during practice to close out the Organized Sports Benefit.  I did that and uploaded the email from the coach at 12:16pm 1/9/25 to the claim which was still in “Partially Approved” Status.  When I logged on that evening (1/9/25) just to check, it showed the claim changed from “Partially Approved” to “Denied” at 12:25pm.   

What changed to prompt the downgrade to “Denied”?

I contacted them and they keep saying that it’s not an accident.   I focused them to the addendum to the medical record citing the “acute  injury” and “sudden onset of instability and pain”  and they said “I wonder did the examiner see this because that would be considered an accident”.  They said they would note the file but I had no more appeals.  

So here I am, yet another victim of paying into an insurance that is completely useless. It’s infuriating!!!!  Something has to be done to stop these companies from this robbery!!
