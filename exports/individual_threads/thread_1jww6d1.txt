Original Post: I was recently in the hospital for a discectomy to remove a herniated disk.

The surgery took place on 3/3 but I am seeing most of the claims processed. Most of them have been covered by insurance as I met my out of pocket maximum pretty quickly. 

However one charge for $16,000 is showing as only partially paid by insurance. When I called to ask why that is I was told the provider was out of network. The insurance agent then went on to say this type of claim is what should be covered by the No Surprises Act yet it was still only partially paid. In total my EOB says I owe about $14,000 of the original amount.

This is the only claim made by this specific provider, everything else charged by the hospital was paid in full.

I am not sure what to do next, I feel this type of claim is exactly what laws like the No Surprises Act are meant to prevent.

Has anyone been in a similar situation?

I live in Illinois and my insurance provider is Blue Cross Blue Shield Illinois and is a PPO plan. When I attempt to search for the provider online, ‘PHYSICIAN OVERSIGHT LLC’, the only match is for a company in Texas. There is no number to call on the EOB so I am not sure if this is the same company, but would probably explain why it was out of network.
