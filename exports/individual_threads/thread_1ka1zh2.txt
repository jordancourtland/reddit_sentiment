Original Post: Make it make sense. I have hit my out of pocket max and continue to get billed. I posted earlier about waiting for a large claim to be processed and now that it has been processed it clearly shows I have paid above and beyond my OOP max. I continue to get invoices, so I call the provider and notify them that I have hit my out of pocket max and this should have been covered... they say to call my insurance because if they resubmit my claim it will be denied as a duplicate. So, I call my insurance (BCBS) and they give me the run around and eventually send my inquiry to another department and advise they will call back. 

I am honestly just frustrated and wondering if there is a better way to do this. 

1. Will I have to reach out to every provider I paid after the large claim was *submitted* (not processed) to get a refund? 
2. Do they automatically process the refunds, as appropriate, although it may take awhile? 
3. Should I keep paying invoices I get so I don't get sent to collections? 

ERG. I thought the injury and rehabilitation from the same was a pain, but this seems to be the real pain!
