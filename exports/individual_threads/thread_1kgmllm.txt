Original Post: Just found out today, on my own; the speech and occupational therapy center my son has been going to hasn’t had a single approved claim since we started going there in January. 

I logged into his insurance portal and noticed the amount we have paid towards his maximum out of pocket isn’t anywhere near where it should be. We have been paying a 90 dollar copay 3x a week. We should be approaching our max out of pocket.

After we reach our MOOP we no longer have to pay copays.

I called his insurance and found out the speech place never submitted the authorization, therefore all the claims have been getting denied. The BCBS insurance lady was acting like it was the most messed up thing she’s ever seen before. She kept saying things like “I’m so sorry” “they should have fixed this months ago”. 

The Insurance lady said that on this most recent monday they submitted therapy approval but incorrectly, so it was denied.

Now I’m stressing because does this not essentially mean I am on the hook for the cash price of every single speech appointment? Even though it’s their fault they never submitted the approval. I confirmed with the insurance this is not something I submit on my own; it is something the speech company submits.

I called the speech center, it’s a very small local business I spoke directly with the owner and tried to calmly explain it while my heart is beating out of my chest. She said she would call my insurance.

Does anyone have any idea what happens now? I’ve heard mixed opinions and some people are saying things like if they don’t bill it in time they have to refund my copays and I don’t really know what to do
