Original Post: Soo, just received a claim denial from Anthem stating I owed 22K for my 2.5 day stay. 

I went to the Urgent Care with an increased heart rate. That, with my high blood pressure, had them call an ambulance. I was diagnosed with tachycardia.

After the ambulance took me in, the doctor said my white blood cell count was incredibly high and he thought my body was fighting off an infection so he said I had to stay, I had no say.

Fast forward and the white blood cell count went down and I left with medication for my heart.

I’m at a total loss here. The ambulance gave me no say in what hospital I was going to and it drove me to an out-of-network hospital. 

I am to call Anthem correct? Do I wait for a bill from the hospital? I can dispute that the reason  for my stay wasn’t my heart which was denied, but for the potential infection?

Any advise would be very helpful, I’m in full panic mode.
