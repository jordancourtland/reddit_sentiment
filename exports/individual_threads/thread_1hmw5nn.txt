Fit Explanation: The original poster is dealing with a denial and seeking clarity on liability, indicating a good fit for appeal assistance.
Original Post: I received a medical bill from a recent birth. I noticed that medical bill did not go through insurance (verified with my insurance company that they had not received any claims from this company yet and they have not.)
After looking more closely at the medical bill statement, I noticed that they put my first and last name backwards and thereâ€™s a code at the bottom (PR-31) that says this has been denied because patient cannot be identified as insured

Question: if they have the wrong information on this bill, am I still liable to pay?
