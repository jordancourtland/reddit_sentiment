Original Post: Location: **Florida**

Health Plan: **Employer's Higher Deductible HSA Medical Plan**

The preventive visit and vaccine was administered about six months ago.

I think I've done my due diligence. Logged into member website and verified the pediatrician is in-network. I called the customer help line and they confirmed that the pediatrician is in-network. Preventive services should be covered at 100% at this doctor's office.

I tried to do a second level appeal after the first appeal was denied. The appeal letter:

*"Our decision: According to the terms of your Employer's Higher Deductible HSA medical plan design, out-of-network preventive visit and services are covered at 60% of the Maximum Allowed Amount based on the 80th percentile of Fair Health Pricing subject to your annual deductible responsibility. Tis claim processed and applied $XXX.XX towards your out-of-network deductible.*

*Your employer's Higher Deductible HSA medical plan design has a specific network according to the state where you live. Florida Network Blue. In order to process at the in-network benefit level, your provider must be a POS Network Provider in their respective state to receive network benefits. Children's Health Alliance is not a participating provider in your POS network. Since this provider is not participating in your state's POS network, the claim processed correct per the terms of you medical plan design.*

*You may contact the Accolade Member Services at the number on your member IF card to locate a POS network Provider in your area."*

I read that if a doctor/provider is no longer in-network they have 15 days to contact my health insurance company to remove themselves from the "in-network" providers. The fact that they're still listing this pediatrician as in-network as of today is extremely deceptive. It feels like I'm a victim of a bait-n-switch and currently on the hook for the out-of-network bill.

What other further actions or rights do I have at this point?
