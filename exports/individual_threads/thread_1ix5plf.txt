Original Post: Hello! I switched jobs and my insurance provider is changing, but there is an unresolved claim on my previous insurance. I had some blood tests done in July 2024, and the claim was denied. According to the EOB, the provider needed to provide more information to the insurance company. When I called the provider, they said theyâ€™re waiting on my doctor to give them the info so they can give it to the insurance company. My coverage will end as of March 1. Will they be unable to appeal/resolve the denied claim when the policy expires? Thank you!
