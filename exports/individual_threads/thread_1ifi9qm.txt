Original Post: I posted before about downcoding CPT 99214 to CPT 99213 by Aetna - and winning the appeal but having to repeatedly contact them to ensure the reprocessing was corrected.   
  
I contacted the Insurance Board who has contacted Aetna.  I'm waiting for a response.

**Important notes:** I am medically complex and very costly to Aetna.  They have regularly made errors processing my claims - that seem to increase when I'm hitting deductibles and max out of pocket.  

My husband is less complex - more acute concerns and medical issues.

**That in mind...** Something told me to check for differences in how they processed CPT 99214 (same type service same type provider) for my husband vs. for me...

*Wait for it...*

They did not downcode for him.  Not only didn't they downcode, they did not "disallow" any of the money associated with the code.

**Both providers are out of network.  Both providers are in the same specialty.**

Thoughts?
