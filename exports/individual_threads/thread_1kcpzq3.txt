Original Post: Hello, I posted about a situation in a different subreddit. 

My family member went into a psychotic episode and voluntarily signed for admission into a behavioral hospital. This was after being assessed in the emergency department of the same hospital and per the ER physician’s recommendation. They were in psychosis; they believed things that were not real. There were cooperative with the doctors and nurses in the ER.

They were in the the inpatient behavioral unit for 5.5 days. From a Sunday (5:20pm) evening until a Thursday (10:20am) morning. They were diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder I. They were placed on medication and discharge with a follow up appointment with a psychiatrist. They have kept that follow up and are now compliant with their medication.

The reason they had to sign for voluntary admission was that while they were in psychosis, they were NOT considered a threat to themselves or others. However, the doctor and social worker agreed they should be hospitalized.

They received a letter from their insurance provider, Meridian Health, denying the claim because “they’re mood improved.”

We have the ability to appeal the decision. My question is how do I go about it? I can print out notes and such that the physicians wrote whilst they were in hospital as supporting documentation. But what else do I do? 

Do I need to contact the ER physician to ask that they write a letter stating that my relative should have been admitted? Do I need to do the same for the social worker? Should I contact the hospitals financial advocacy team?

I don’t even know how to write an appeal. Any help would be greatly appreciated. Please.
