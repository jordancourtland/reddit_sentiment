Been going back and fourth with the provider and insurance, somehow this is still not resolved with both parties pointing the finger at one another.

The insurance claiming the claim is being denied because it is being sent to the wrong insurance:

&gt;SINCE OCT. 14, 2012, SERVICES REFERRED BY A HEALTH CARE PROVIDER WHO'S NOT LOCATED IN MICHIGAN MUST BE SENT TO THE BLUES PLAN THAT SERVES THAT AREA. PLEASE ASK THE PROVIDER TO SEND THIS CLAIM TO THE OTHER BLUES PLAN. (F956)

According to the provider this means the claim is being denied, so they can keep trying to bill me:

&gt;Per the EOB is said, “REFERRED BY A HEALTH CARE PROVIDER WHOS NOT LOCATED IN MI MUST BE SENT TO THE BLUES PLAN THAT SERVICES THAT AREA.” The doctor is register in NV and we has submitted the claim over to them for processing but they denied it as other insurance is primary.

I don't know what they even mean by this as I only have the one insurance, they go on to say: 

&gt;You must update your Coordination of benefits before they will process this claim. YOU need to tell them you have no other insurance, or we will keep getting the same denial.

I don't know who "Them" is, but I assume my insurance company who just repeats verbatim what the coordination of benefits says to me.

I don't know where to take this because the insurance wants me to tell the provider to send it to the right insurance while the provider is telling me its the insurance company that is denying it.  The provider at least seems to be listening to me, while BCBS just repeats the coordination of benefits and they seem to be an endless loop of the same non-solutions.

Meanwhile the bills keep coming.
