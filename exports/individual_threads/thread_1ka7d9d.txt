Original Post: I was denied coverage when applying for Medicaid renewal, and my coverage ends in 2 days. 
My psychiatrist has sent in multiple refill requests with my pharmacy to help bridge until I can find another plan, and she had sent in a 90 day refill earlier this month, but the pharmacist tells me I do Not have any more refills and can’t process any refill requests early. 
I am ok with paying out of pocket for these refills, but will the prescription still stand in a month? Will I be able to fill these medications if she sent in refills prior to me losing health coverage, or will these refill requests disappear effectively making it so I can’t pick up my meds without getting another psych appointment (which is quite expensive out of pocket)?
