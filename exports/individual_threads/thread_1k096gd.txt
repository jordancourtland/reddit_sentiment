Original Post: I had surgery for endometriosis done in February and my surgeon‚Äôs office asked me to pay upfront and out of pocket $8k then said they would run it through insurance. Well it has been a nightmare getting their billing department (located in a different state from the clinic) to run this through insurance appropriately. They tried running it several times and it wasn‚Äôt denied, but just never went through. I did a 3-way call with insurance and the office‚Äôs billing department rep today and we found out that they never gave the group number to my insurance ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è  

Billing then told me that this is usually a 6-9 month process before I am reimbursed. Which sounds insane to me. 

Also, I‚Äôve heard from the office that insurance will reimburse me. Then billing said the office would reimburse me. I‚Äôm so confused and feel like I just keep getting the run around. 

Im wondering if I‚Äôd be better off running it through insurance myself online by filing my own claim with my statement. 

Does anyone have experience with anything like this? I‚Äôm so exhausted and I‚Äôm going through IVF on top of this and could really use the funds.
