Fit Explanation: The user is actively seeking clarification on a potential claim denial related to their diagnosis codes.
Original Post: Iâ€™m in Oregon and have a self-funded plan from my employer in another state. In my plan there is a clause specifically denying coverage for Gender Identity Disorder.

Im a trans person, but I established care with a primary care doctor for an unrelated health reason. I noticed on my report it stated a diagnostic code for Gender Identity Disorder. There were other diagnostic codes that I know for sure are covered under my plan but will the presence of the GID code cause an insurance company to deny the claim? It was a primary care appointment for preventative care

EDIT: Insurance is through UMR (United Healthcare)
