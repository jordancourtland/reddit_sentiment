Original Post: I had surgery for a total thyroidectomy last year at an in-network hospital with a third-party, out-of-network provider performing intraoperative nerve monitoring during the procedure. My insurance (BCBS) denied the nerve monitoring claim for being 'not medically necessary.' I've checked the insurance medical policy and it does show that it should be covered so I can only guess there was a missing document or some clerical error that caused the issue, but I couldn't get a definite answer from talking to insurance. I have not received a bill yet!

I was able to find out that the provider has filed an appeal with insurance with more documentation, but i don't know if that is enough. Should I also file a personal appeal to keep my options open? Or would it have no effect since the process has already been started? I don't want to miss my opportunity to appeal if I need to as the 180-day limit is approaching.
