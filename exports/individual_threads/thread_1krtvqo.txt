Original Post: Hi Insurance Professionals. Do you know of any companies that provide speciality medical insurance for gestational surrogates? 

I’m looking to buy a backup medical policy for our amazing surrogate, who we worked with before. We previously used New Life Agency, but they denied our surrogate coverage / eligibility this time due to a slightly early but otherwise healthy delivery. 

We like our surrogate a lot, but are nervous to proceed without a contingent medical policy as we are both risk averse people. We paid a company to look at her policy and it is considered low risk of cancellation or clawback etc. she had the same insurance last time and it went through just fine. We were able to get AD&amp;D no problem, so we are just looking to get a policy, if possible, for extended medical care / contingency medical care. 

Does anyone have any recommendations or firms that specialize in These types of policies?  Is it Lloyd’s of London, New Life or bust? 

Grateful for any recommendations. This is the last thing standing between me and my hope of completing my family. Thank you.
