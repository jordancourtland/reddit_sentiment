Original Post: Hi everyone,

Last year, when I turned 26, I applied for Medicaid since I was still in school and didn’t have a job yet. I got approved. Recently, I started a full-time job at a hospital (weekends + overnight shifts with differential pay) and enrolled in the health insurance they offer, just in case Medicaid drops me due to my new income.

I just got my new insurance card in the mail, and I’m wondering: should I call Medicaid or just keep reporting my income every payday? I remember that once before, a claim was denied because they thought I had dual coverage, even though I didn’t. I had to call and prove my old insurance had ended.

So far, I haven’t gotten any notice from Medicaid. I’m still new to this. what should I do?

Thanks in advance!
