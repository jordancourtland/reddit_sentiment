Original Post: My baby’s hypoallergenic formula claim got denied. When I tried to contact them, the representative I spoke with said I had all the documents needed from the doctor’s office and an appeal was not needed. She sent it to reprocess the claim. I’m still waiting on it. My phone app still says the claim is denied. Anton faced a similar situation like this? Need advise and inputs on how to go ahead on this
