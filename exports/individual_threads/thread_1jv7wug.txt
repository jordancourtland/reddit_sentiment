Original Post: I’m a 1 1/2 year breast cancer survivor. I was laid off 10/23 and wanted to keep my same coverage because of my treatment. I was making 2 to 3 payments at a time. August, I made what I thought 3 payments and put a calendar reminder to make my last 2 payments for the year. 

My reconstruction surgery was schedule for 10/23/24. My doctor had gotten approval and called to confirm coverage but was never told my policy had canceled for nonpayment. I asked my doctor about nerve attachment so they called to see if that was covered but was told no. I called COBRA to see if nerve attachment was covered but was told no because it’s considered experimental. 

I received several letters stating nerve attachment wasn’t covered but never said the surgery wasn’t covered. The letters never said I had no coverage and if I had the surger, it would be out of pocket. If I was made aware each time I called or in the letters, I would have reschedule my surgery until January 1, 2025. Now my doctors and the hospital is looking to me to pay $300,000+ which I can’t pay. I’ve appealed but was denied. My last appeal said I need to contact my former employer which I just sent copy of my appeal and the letters I receive. A

Anyone know an attorney in Texas I can contact?
