Original Post: Any advise would be appreciated.

In April of 2023 my Original PCP retired and I was notified by the Hospital that an ARNP would be assuming their patients and would be my PCP.

(I did check with Anthem if the ARNP was covered and requested them to update my info to her)

ARNP ordered bloodwork for me to check my cholesterol and a follow up to go over the results.

10 months later I received a bill of $409 for a denied claim stating it wasn't approved by my PCP.

One call to Anthem later and they state some random doctor in a town 25 miles away, in a hospital I've never been too, is my PCP and get authorization next time.

Not once was I notified by Anthem of this change and now have an unexpected medical bill from 10 months ago.

I've already submitted a formal grievance/appeal with Anthem. I'm going to speak with my Hospital's billing department tomorrow and see what can be done.

Has anyone gone through a similar experience, or have any advise? I'm not paying the bill (due in 3 weeks) until this is straightened out.


I'm 35, in Maine, and make about $40k.
