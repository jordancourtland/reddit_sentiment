Original Post: My wife and I had her first baby last Thursday. Everything went smoothly and both are healthy! We are looking at scheduling his pediatrician and they have asked whose insurance he would be under.

Initially, I wanted him under mine as it is $100 cheaper per month. But my wife registered at the hospital before giving birth with her insurance. Moreover, I’ve read countless horror stories on here on claims being denied retroactively when father tries to add baby to their insurance.

Is it a simple as me just adding him onto mine or is it going to cause issues with the hospital bills? We are leaning towards adding him to hers, even with it being more expensive, just to avoid headaches.

Thank you!
