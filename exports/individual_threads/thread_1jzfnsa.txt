Original Post: So my dental insurance covers dental implants, with no co pay to me. My dentist that works with/accepts my insurance has done pre authorizations with them before for a previous implant. This new implant however, after my surgery was done, the front desk person told me how much I owed, which was like almost 3 grand. I looked at her confused and asked her why my insurance wasn't covering it? She said "typically insurance doesn't cover this procedure", so I took it to mean they didn't even file the prior authorization. I pointed out to her that my insurance covered the last one, and she pulled it up in my chart. She hesitantly said okay, typed a few things in her computer, then said that I don't owe anything *for now*. Fast forward to 3 weeks later, I got a letter from my insurance company saying they denied the claim because "this surgery required prior approval from your dentist and they did not submit one, we have told this to your dentist." I believe they submitted for the prior authorization AFTER my surgery. Am I going to be responsible for this $3,300 bill? I called my insurance and they told me my dentist didn't submit prior authorization. When I called my dentist to ask why they didn't, the woman at the front desk (I believe it was a different woman) said she was confused because her office SHOULD HAVE requested it, became obviously flustered, and giving very weak excuses as to why it wasn't. They ended up filing a retroactive prior authorization with myself and my insurance in the phone. My question is, if the retroactive prior authorization gets denied, then my appeals get denied, can my dentist office require me to pay the bill (even though they should have filed the prior authorization in the first place)? I live in NY, and I'm reading in a bunch of places online that it's the doctors responsibility to file the prior authorization for dental implants, that it's required by Medicaid law. I can't afford 3300 bucks....
