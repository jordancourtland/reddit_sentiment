Original Post: On a gap plan until my new shiny job's insurance kicks in. 

I'm just aggravated. I've been on cimzia for 15 years. They've always been buts about it but it's only been the last two years various insurance companies have been aggressively bad about it. I called the one and was literally told that "because of Ozempic they're denying more specialty medications." Cool, I have psoriatic arthritis but o.k.

But yes, before I bought this plan I checked to make sure cimzia was covered, especially since I've heard that marketplace plans are now denying almost everything until they know for sure that the ACA isn't getting repealed. However, now they're claiming that they just don't cover specialty meds, even tho it's listed in their formulary. They're claiming that it's not part of their prescription plan, but that it might be part of their medical plan. 

This is Highmark, btw. I've previously had Blue Cross.

Is any one else dealing with this? My doc is appealing but getting no where.
