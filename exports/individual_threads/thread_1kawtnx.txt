Confidence: 0.7
Denial Type: Out of network
Outcome: Unclear
OP Summary: The original poster is seeking advice on how to negotiate or dispute medical bills that were denied by insurance for being out of network, despite being told otherwise by the providers' office staff.
Responses Summary: Commenters suggest asking for a self-pay discount and setting up a payment plan, while also recommending a book on negotiating medical bills.
Themes: negotiation strategies, self-pay discounts, financial hardship
Options Suggested: ask for self-pay discount, set up a payment plan, read 'Never pay the first bill'
Fit Explanation: The original poster is actively seeking help with a current denial situation, indicating a very good fit for assistance.
Original Post: I have medical bills from two providers (and additional testing from third parties during those visits) that I want to negotiate/ dispute. 

My insurance has denied the claims for not being in network (which turned out to be accurate), but when I visited the providers the office staff told me that they did in fact take my insurance after giving them them my insurance card (they apparently did not verify the specific plan, which they do not take).

Since these visits were denied by insurance and would be entirely out of pocket can I use that to negotiate down?

Since the office staff told me they were in network (not documented) can I use that to negotiate/ dispute?

A friend has had success by simply saying that they are unable to pay a bill and that trying to do so would create a financial burden. In my case that's absolutely the truth as I'm now unemployed due to illness. Any tips for this approach?

Any input would be greatly appreciated! The total amount is nearing 10K :(
