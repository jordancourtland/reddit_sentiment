Original Post: My daughter and I are in between insurance right now and our new coverage doesn’t start till July 1. We have an appointment set up for her next week for an initial consultation at a neurological center at a local children’s hospital (in NE) but I just received an invoice from them for $502 saying it’s due at the time we check in. We can’t afford that right now. 

Can they legally deny service if we can’t pay at the appointment?
