Original Post: Another denial from United Healthcare/UMR.

Our teenage son was diagnosed with **pectus excavatum**, a structural deformity where the sternum sinks inward, compressing the chest cavity and reducing room for the heart and lungs. The severity is measured using something called the **Haller Index (HI)**, which compares the width of the chest to the depth of the indentation.

Here’s how it breaks down:

* **Normal chest:** HI &lt; 2.0
* **Mild deformity:** HI 2.0–3.2
* **Moderate deformity:** HI 3.2–3.5
* **Severe deformity:** HI &gt; 3.5

Our son’s **Haller Index is 5.8**.

That’s not borderline—it’s deep into the *severe* category. An **MRI confirmed** the deformity is compressing his heart and lungs. His **heart is displaced and rotated**, and **lung function is reduced**.

Despite that, **UMR denied coverage** for the corrective surgery, stating that his lung volume isn’t low enough to meet their criteria.

But here's the critical nuance: our son is a **competitive athlete**—despite his condition he swims indoor/outdoor and runs track and cross country. He works extremely hard to **compensate** for the condition, but rarely wins his events. Instead of having a high cardio-respiratory performance (which would be expected at his training level), his metrics are simply average. That should raise red flags, not eliminate them.

He also **faints easily**, another concern the surgeon connected to the compressed chest cavity.

The **cardiothoracic surgeon strongly recommends surgery now**, while he’s young, to prevent long-term damage and reduced heart/lung capacity as he grows. And yet, our insurance provider doesn’t see that as “medically necessary.”

We’re appealing the decision, but we’re incredibly frustrated. We pay our premiums. We followed protocol. We trusted that clear medical evidence and a specialist’s recommendation would be enough.

If you’ve appealed a case like this before—or if you work inside the industry and know how to get someone at UMR to look deeper—we would truly appreciate your help.

And if anyone from **UMR** is reading this: please reconsider. A child’s long-term health shouldn’t be decided by narrow policy language that fails to account for medical nuance.
