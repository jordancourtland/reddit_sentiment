Original Post: I'll keep this short. My wife retired at the end of last year. She worked for the state prison system for 27 years and her insurance covered he Trintellix for the past 12 years. Now her post-employment insurance  company denied coverage, lol. The out-of-pocket cost is $500 a month. Can't afford it. Any point in appealing?
