Original Post: Context: I received a septorhinoplasty last year due to breathing issues which was completely covered by my insurance since it was medically necessary. Following the surgery and the way my bones healed, I had protruding bumps all over my nose. My ENT suggested that I get the bumps “rasped” down in a much smaller rasping procedure and that many times, insurance will cover it since it’s a procedure following a medically necessary. 

I called over and over and the surgical scheduler told me multiple times it was covered but did not require any pre authorization. The surgeon even mentioned to me that it could have been done in office under local anesthesia, and when I suggested it he said he’s rather just do it as a normal surgical procedure. 

Well my insurance denied the claim and now was billed 13k for a full rhinoplasty. I feel like I got tricked. 

Any suggestions on what I can do??? Or how to negotiate this bill cdown?
