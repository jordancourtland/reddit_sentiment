Original Post: Hi everyone! Looking for some advice/ to see if anyone has been in a similar situation. I went to the ER for severe back pain and because that doesn’t fall under their reasons for an emergency, they denied my claim. I’ve appealed it once to which they’ve “stuck by their decision”. I’m going to appeal it again but is there anything I can say to help my case? When I spoke with the health concierge she wrote down why I chose to go to the ER because the doctor was extremely dismissive and his notes reflect that so that obviously doesn’t help me. I have never had to fight my insurance on anything so this is new territory for me. Thank you!
