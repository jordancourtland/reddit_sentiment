Original Post: Hello! My husband was working at a job that provided dental insurance. About a month before he left the job we went to the dentist and he had to get a deep clean done. We asked the dental office if that would be a problem with the insurance coverage considering he was leaving in a month. They assured us it wouldnâ€™t be and stated that as long as we were paying the insurance, we would have coverage. 
Well, we received a letter in the mail from the dental office stating that they had submitted the claim to the insurance and that they denied the coverage twice. They said we should call our insurance and try to fight the rejection and if the insurance still chose to deny us that we would have to pay out of pocket for the work. 
I thought as long as my husband was paying our insurance and still at the job, we were covered. Is that incorrect? 
Is there anything we can do/say when we call our old insurance that will give us a better chance of getting our bill  covered by them?
