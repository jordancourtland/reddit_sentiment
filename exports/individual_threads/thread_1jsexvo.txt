Original Post: So I have really bad neuropathy and have had for like 15 years. Can't feel anything below my knees. I developed a foot ulcer that was just not healing and after going to a foot specialist for 3 years my GP sent me to a wound specialist in Jan. My company had just switched to united health care so I wasn't very familiar with them. I went to the wound specialist every week or every other week for 2 months and
I was actually seeing a lot of improvement and was feeling pretty good about it when my insurance told me they were denying a lot of the services so now I owe over $6,000! And this is on top of the $200 I had to pay every time just to go see him as a specialist. 

But the things that they are denying are things like the wound pad and the gauze that they wrapped my foot in for me to leave the office. The Doctor cuts away a lot of old flesh every time and its on the botton
of my foot so am I just supposed to leave his office with a big open wound? Am I supposed to bring my own gauze? It's also saying that I got a device several times, but I never got any type of device. Also the amount that the doctor's office is charging for just a little bit of gauze is insane. It's saying that the gauze or pads are 16-48 sq in and they were just small squares so maybe my doctors office was padding the bill, but I'm  not sure. 

I've tried appealing it but what else should I be doing? 
I've stopped seeing the doctor because I can't afford that so now I'm just back to not healing and having a constant worry that it's gonna get infected and I'm going to end up having my foot amputated.
