Original Post: So long story short, got in a car wreck 7 years ago. I messed up my back and hip, and have been dealing with chronic pain since then off and on. Only just settled last year with their insurance. Got a payout, that wasn’t much after all the medical bills, attorney fees, etc. 

I’m with a new job, new location, and new health insurance. If I go to my doctor and say I need injections due to chronic pain from a car accident that happened 7 years ago, is my insurance going to deny my claim and make me pay out of pocket? I know during my original car accident claim there was some sub rogation for certain things but my health insurance still covered a fair amount.
