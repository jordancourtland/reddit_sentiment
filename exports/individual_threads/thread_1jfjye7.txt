Original Post: Ive been trying to get this surgery for the past 2 years now, but my insurance refuses to cover it on the grounds its not medically necessary, i have seen multiple doctors and have had plenty of refferals, plenty of evidence to back up my claims etc, &amp; even the surgeon doing a p2p right before it was supposed to be scheduled, yet they still deny deny deny. I already appealed twice which is the maximum amount of times you can appeal &amp; even asked for a plan exception, nothing. 

The surgery code is 21193 &amp; The OOP cost for the surgery is about 10 grand, not including anesthesia 

I am a 19 y/o F who was abused &amp; neglected and did not get medical or dental care until i was a teenager, i have needed extensive dental work &amp; medical work done as is and this is just the one thing stopping me from being in constant pain, my face constantly hurts &amp; swells and probably the best part, there is no cartilage left in my jaw! &amp; yet the insurance will still claim its "Not Medically Necessary".

How can i get my insurance to cover it?? Is there any insurances that do cover these type of procedures???
