Original Post: Hi everyone! Sorry this is long..

I feel dumb when it comes to medical bills/insurance and I need advice on what my next step should be.

My 12 year old daughter had a bicycle accident in May 2023 and had to go to the ER.
She had a CT of her head, face, and neck.

I got the hospital bill a few months later,  paid what I owed and had no issues. 

In January of this year,  I receive a text from the radiology group that read her CT (it was sent to them because it was after hours) with a bill for almost $2000. It said insurance denied coverage.

I called my insurance they said they never received the claim and I later confirmed that with my EOBs. 
I called the radiology group back and told them they never sent the claim in.  They said they would do that and that I could get stuck with the bill because it's 8 months later.  

Today,  I receive a text saying I owe them $2000, but this reason was because I didn't have insurance coverage at the time of the accident. YES I DID!

So I'm waiting until Monday to call them to tell them I did have insurance. 

My question is... what do I do if they do submit it to insurance and insurance denies it because now it's 10 months after the accident? Or what if the radiology group still tells me I didn't have coverage? I don't want to be sent to collections but I don't want to pay $2000 just because someone can't do their job! 

Thank you!
