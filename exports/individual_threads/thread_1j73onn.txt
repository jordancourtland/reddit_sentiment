Original Post: I’ve never had to worry about health insurance before, so I have not learned any of the insurance lingo or terms. I’m in a very specific, very tricky situation.
I was in an accident 2 years ago that I am still recovering from. I have a plastic surgery that I still need done to complete the recovery. At the same time, I am being kicked off of my parents insurance.
Is there a reputable insurer that young adults generally use? My parents suggested AmBetter, but their reviews are really poor and lots of reviews say they deny coverage for surgeries.
I’m willing to pay a premium if it means I can get better care throughout my recovery. I still need physical therapy and a permanent shoe-lift made. I’m hoping to find insurance that will cover me through all of this. I cannot get insurance through an employer, because I can’t hold any serious jobs that offer insurance while I am going through recovery.
Any tips are appreciated, thank you in advance!
