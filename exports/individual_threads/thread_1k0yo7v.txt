Original Post: If anyone can help, please give advice.

My kid is 3, I lost insurance about 6 months ago and am self employed.  We were denied benefits because I don't have all the documents they want.  I can't navigate healthcare.gov to find a child only policy.  I also can't seem to find anything online that doesn't take me back to CHIP.  
He needs dental and health coverage.  I don't know how to do this.  I'm a single mom, no child support coming in and my income is unstable.  I owe a lot of debt too. 

Is there an easier way to help him?  What am I supposed to do?
