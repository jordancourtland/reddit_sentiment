Original Post: Hi, I’ve seen some past posts about this company before but they’re always comment disabled. I’m pretty desperate for advice or any support at this point. At the end of 2023 I was sold a “First Health Network” plan from “Innovative Partners” by Covered California. I was told it was a “PPO” plan with comparable coverage to the others they sold. I was also told this was my only option based on my zip code, time of enrollment, budget, and providers I needed to remain in network. Once enrolled I discovered none of these promised things were true. None of my providers were covered, copays were extraordinarily high, and they surprised me by refusing to cover any prescription meds or vaccines. My antidepressants I’ve taken for years were suddenly hundreds of dollars a month. My annual flu shot and covid shot were out of pocket and $300. It took me months to get off the plan and on a “better” plan. During this time they denied every claim I made, refused to answer customer service calls, ignored my emails, and wouldn’t pay their part of claims unless I called over and over again. I am now in about $10k medical debt as a result. I am STILL getting collections calls and bills that I cannot afford for claims they never paid. I’ve had to appeal and complain probably a dozen times to the CA Department of Managed Healthcare with little success. When I would describe my situation to family or healthcare providers they would respond “are you being scammed? Because that sounds like a scam.” I’m running out of options as they delay and deny me to death. Oh and I should mention I’m chronically ill and do not get healthcare coverage through my employers. This has also majorly impacted my credit and if I don’t figure out how to pay off the medical debt I fear I will have to start eliminating some of my medication and treatments to make ends meet. Please please help!! I’m shocked there’s not a class action against this company yet, you can see the hundreds of complaints on their BBB page. I’ll take any advice/help I can
