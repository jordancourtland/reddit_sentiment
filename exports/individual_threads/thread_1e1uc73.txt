Original Post: Took my daughter for her wellness exam.

Annual wellness visit is supposed to be covered 100%

Doctor including a mental health assessment as part of the exam and now insurance says this assessment is subject to my deductible.  I’m on the hook for $141.

This assessment was 2 or 3 questions during the exam.  1 minute.

Doctor says she coded the visit as a well child visit and the hospital system automatically adds the codes for the assessment.

Hospital claims they coded it correctly and it’s my problem the insurance didn’t cover it.

I’m pissed because it wasn’t disclosed to me that this would be a separate charge outside of the wellness visit.

I’ve appealed the claim with my insurance and have also tried contesting the bill with the doctor’s billing department.

Seems like an easy scam for the medical system to milk patients for extra charges.
