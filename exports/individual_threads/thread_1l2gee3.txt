Original Post: Looking for advice.  Is there anything I should be careful saying?  My emergency claim was denied for more information &amp; I need to call my health plan. 
It was for a fall with small head injury needing four stitches in another state.   They were concerned for brain bleed and orbit damage so I had to get 2 head cat scans which I tried to get out of.  We went to urgent care but they transferred our case to the emergency room to evaluate with the cat scans and for the stitches.
