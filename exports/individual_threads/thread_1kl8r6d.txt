Original Post: I’m dealing with a frustrating situation with Aetna. It’s a non ERISA plan and Initially, they denied my claim under a “general plan exclusion”. I asked for a reconsideration and they changed the denial reason to “not medical necessary.” After the level 1 appeal, they switched to the cosmetic exclusion instead. Now, after the level 2 appeal, they’ve switched back again to “not medically necessary.” Under my plan, these are not overlapping, “cosmetic” and “medical necessity” are entirely separate, unrelated bases for denial.

I’ve provided documentation and justification addressing their stated reason at each level,  Then they change the reason without any explanation provided. How am I supposed to effectively appeal a denial when the denial reason keeps shifting? It feels like they’re moving the goalposts.
