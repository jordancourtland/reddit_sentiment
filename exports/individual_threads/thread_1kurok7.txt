Original Post: Hello, BCBS just denied my claim for a stool test due to not having "severe loose stools". I had been bitten by a neighbors dog and taken Augmentin which destroyed my gut.

I did have SEVERE bright green loose stools. I was sitting on the toliet almost all day on the verge of crying due to pain. I was literally pissing out of my ass. 

I noticed on my doctor's notes he just stated "diarrhea".. is there any hope of appealing this? 

Thank you
