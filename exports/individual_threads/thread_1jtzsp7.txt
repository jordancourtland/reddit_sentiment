Original Post: update:  I did some more digging and I guess the appeal was overturned a month ago. they didn't notify me, my health advocate, or the lab. I called the lab and they know it was overturned but the insurance hasn't provided them with an EOB or anything so they are reaching out. 



â€‹I had some blood work done in August and 2 of the 4 were considered experimental so they were denied. I appealed this claim and they told me they would get back to me in 90 days. I waited but didn't hear anything so I sent them a reminder. They told me it was going to take another 90 days, I don't know why it needed to go to someone else but it sounded like it was going to the next step or they forgot about it? I told them I already waited and making me wait again is not ok, it's against their policy.

I went to my state, CA, to complain. California says they don't have power because it's actually a Maryland insurance. I went to the State of Maryland and they eventually told me that because it's a work provided insurance they can't do anything. They suggested I seek a health advocate. By the time I heard back from Maryland, the provider said they will send it to collections. I have a temporary hold on the bill through that provider. So much time has passed that I dumped my old insurance because it was so expensive. I tried reaching out after getting off that plan and they flat out ignore me now.

Eventually, I find my health advocate and tell them what's going on about a month ago. They just told me they spoke with my insurance and that I only had 180 days to file an appeal and that I can't negotiate now. I am so frustrated with this. I told them that's BS because I initiated the appeal in August last year. They are deliberately ignoring me at this point and lying to my advocates. Tth advocate say that they are totally allowed to do this and I shouldn't bother trying to sue and Maryland says maybe I should find an attorney. WTF?!
