Original Post: Due to my naivete, I accidentally sought a medical provider who was out-of-network for UnitedHealthcare, which resulted in a denied claim on Nov. 1 of 2024. Based on this, I really don't have any grounds for appealing that denial and I have made peace with that. My medical provider had billed UHC for $1600. However, I have not received a bill or communications from that clinic since. 

So I'm not quite sure what to do. Is this something that I need to follow up on? I'm also paranoid that this bill was sent to collections without me even knowing.

Any advice is appreciated.
