Title: Claim "missing office code" going back and forth with provider and insurance
Subreddit: healthinsurance
Created: 1748637706
Persona Fit: 0.8
Confidence: 0.7
Denial Type: Missing office visit code
Outcome: Ongoing
OP Summary: The original poster is seeking help with a claim denial for allergy bloodwork that was not covered by insurance due to a missing office visit code, despite it being ordered during a preventive visit.
Responses Summary: Commenters suggest that the allergy bloodwork may not be covered as preventive care and emphasize that the insurance will not provide coding guidance. They recommend working with the pediatrician's office to clarify the coding issue and possibly appeal again.
Themes: coding issues, insurance coverage, appeal process
Options Suggested: contact pediatrician for coding clarification, appeal again with detailed visit notes, request a payment plan with Labcorp
Fit Explanation: The original poster is actively dealing with a denial and seeking advice on how to navigate the appeals process, indicating a very good fit for assistance.
Original Post: Our kid had a new patient preventive visit at a new pediatrician who noted chronic stuffiness (she has a history of allergies and chronic post nasal driop) and recommended allergy bloodwork. She gave us an order that included both preventive bloodwork and allergy bloodwork at Labcorp (in-network). Insurance covered the preventive bloodwork portion fully and none of the allergy bloodwork (resulting in a $900 balance to our suprise). By phone the insurance stated the allergy bloodwork items were missing an office visit code and to tell the provider this. I called Labcorp who said we don't know anything about an office visit code so talk to your pediatrician and they can give us direction because the order comes from them. I talked to the pediatrician's office provider and I asked them to call my insurance and they said they called my insurance and told them there was an office visit and the allergy bloodwork items should be covered but they said the insurance rep was not helpful and so the pediatrician's office told us to just take a copy of their full visit notes and appeal with our insurance. I asked the pediatrician if they could request a peer to peer review and they just ignored my request and repeated to for us to just appeal with Anthem. I appealed first level and second level and both insurance appeals were denied saying the claim was processed correctly as coded but it was a preventive visit and that the allergy bloodwork was missing an office visit code and that the "claim did not cover the allergy testing services correctly". I called the pediatrician again told them all this and we also emailed them both appeal responses to read and they just said call Labcorp to ask what codes they used because we gave them Z00.129, Z68.52, and R09.81 on the bloodwork order. I called Labcorp and they confirmed these were the three codes they were provided by the pediatrician to use and Labcorp said call your pediatrician again. Called pediatrician AGAIN and they said they'd call Labcorp and they said they talked it over thoroughly with Labcorp and they both feel the claim is correct, but they added they'd submit a new claim if we called our insurance again to ask specifically what office visit code to use that is missing. I have a feeling if I call my insurance AGAIN (Anthem BCBS and they suck) they will not give me the correct codes because they already did not specify how to correct the claim on the appeals, they said on their appeal responses that they nor I can tell the provider how to code. I am at my wits end going back and forth because I feel the pediatrician's office is hoping I just go away and I feel they should reach out directly to a higher level person at my insurance to obtain the proper information directly but I don't now how to articulate this. I'm not a provider, coder, or insurance rep/expert but somehow I'm supposed to extract and pass information back and forth (half of which I don't understand without googling) to figure this out? Any feedback would been appreciated. Thanks.
