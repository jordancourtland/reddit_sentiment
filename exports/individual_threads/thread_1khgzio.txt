Original Post: I have an Aeatna HMO ACA plan and I do not understand what is going on with my insurance. The specialist said they accept Aetna. Got the referral from my primary. Ive been two times and apparently the claim has been denied both times. Does that mean I am on the hook for the rest of the bill? I do not understand how this works. The office has not mentioned the insurance being denied and have only asked for a co-pay. However, the claims are being denied. What should I do?
