Original Post: I am on my parents insurance plan (Meritain) but I had a child in December. I enrolled my child and I in a plan through my employer (Excellus), and the plan became effective the date of his birth. Now  Meritain has become my secondary payer. Who is supposed to pay for my hospital bill? I was admitted to the hospital 2 days before my child’s birth. Is Meritain responsible for my entire hospital bill or for the two days before my child’s birth? I’ve received a letter in the mail from the hospital telling me that Meritain is denying the claim because I may have another insurance who is supposed to pay first. I called and explained my situation to Meritain and they said they would reprocess the claim. I then received the same letter again a few weeks later.
