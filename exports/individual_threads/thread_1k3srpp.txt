Original Post: I had knee surgery on 3/13. Prior to the surgery the hospital called and asked that I pay the remained of my out of pocket max. My out of pocket max is $9100, and had about $7k remaining. The surgery ended up being billed as $102k (I had all pre authorizations). The claim is still being reviewed and so that $7k I paid is not being applied to my out of pocket max. Since the surgery I’ve had multiple additional medical bills related to the surgery and not. Currently I’m close to hitting my out of pocket max without them applying the $7k. I’m just waiting for them to reviews the claim so that money can be applied and then what.. refunded from the hospital? Hindsight is definitely 20/20 and I wish I would’ve waited and not been pressured to make that payment until it all shook out, but I’m just curious what the average time to review a claim of that size is? How much longer will my waiting game continue?
