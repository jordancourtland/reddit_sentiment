Persona Fit: 0.8
Confidence: 0.7
Denial Type: No prior authorization
Outcome: Unclear
OP Summary: The original poster is concerned about a $57k hospital bill that was denied by their insurance, wondering if they will eventually receive a bill despite the current lack of communication from the hospital.
Responses Summary: Commenters advised that if the hospital failed to obtain pre-authorization, they are likely responsible for the costs and may not bill the OP. However, they cautioned that if the hospital appeals successfully, a bill could come later.
Themes: hospital billing practices, insurance denial reasons, financial assistance
Options Suggested: let it lie, appeal the denial, wait for hospital's action
Fit Explanation: The OP is actively seeking clarity on a denial situation and considering an appeal, indicating a strong fit for needing assistance.
Original Post: I had a planned inpatient surgery three months ago at a large teaching hospital. When the insurance claims came in, the insurance company paid the surgeon and anesthesiologist, but denied the $57k hospital bill (OR suite, 1 night stay, medications). 

EOB lists codes PS1(Charge exceeds allowable, member not liable unless permitted by law) and X12 (Deny Services not authorized, provider resp on covered charges). It says plan paid $0, member responsibility $0.

I have not heard a peep from the hospital, and my billing portal shows no balance. Do they literally just have to eat this, or do I need to be worried I'm going to get a $57k bill? I was tempted to appeal the denial myself just to be sure I don't get hosed, but should I let this sleeping dog lie?

If it's relevant, this hospital says they will automatically run their financial assistance metrics on your balance/income and adjust as needed.
