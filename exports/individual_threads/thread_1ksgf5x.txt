Original Post: Hello everyone,

I’m really hoping someone here can offer, or even just some support. My 71-year-old grandmother recently lost coverage on her Medicaid AND Medicare, and it’s been a nightmare trying to get it reinstated.

She has no job, no income, and she suffers from arthritis and several other chronic health issues that does require ongoing care and medication. Despite filing appeals, making numerous phone calls, and spending hours on hold with customer service reps, nothing has worked. Every time I follow their instructions, they either redirect me, deny her again, or say they’re “working on it” with nothing following up.

We don’t want a private plan that’s going to charge her hundreds a month or offer poor coverage. She simply can’t afford it and neither can I. I’m just trying to find a way to get her ideally free health insurance that actually covers everything she needs. Has anyone been through this before? Are there programs or advocates that can step in? She is located in Michigan. \[I know mentioning the state matters because Medicaid rules vary\].

I am really worried about her health. My grandmother means the world to me, and I have been doing everything I can.

Thank you.
