Original Post: My doctor prescribed a medication that is often used for my medical condition. It was denied because my PBM (Express Scripts) only covers it for two diagnoses, neither of which I have. I have tried and failed (either bad side effects or ineffective) every other medication for my condition. 

Can the decision be appealed? I tried asking Express Scripts but the “claims specialist” didn’t know. There aren’t any FDA-approved medications for my condition but there have been many studies showing the effectiveness of this medication. This is not for a GLP-1 or any other weight loss medication. It is a relatively inexpensive medication.
