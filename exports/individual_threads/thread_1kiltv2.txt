Original Post: I have Cigna insurance, and recently chose a new PCP (in network). I just had my annual physical/wellness exam and to my surprise, was billed $390. 

Looking at the EOB, it looks like I was billed separately for 2 new patient visits. Billing codes 99203 and 99385. For a routine physical/wellness visit that lasted about 30 minutes. I brought up straightforward well visit concerns, requested routine labs (as one does at an annual physical) &amp; when asked about if I had any concerns I mentioned I had been having some gastro issues and my provider recommended a bland diet, and for the Dr to view a skin tag on my leg that she looked at and said not to worry about. This was the extent of my visit (it really was as straightforward as that). I am wondering why I was billed 99385 for "more comprehensive evaluation" when there was none? I find this to be extremely unethical. To my understanding, because preventive &amp; wellness visits come with no cost sharing, it's best practice to explain to patients that a separate service performed during the same visit may result in a charge to them - this did not happen in the appointment. There was absolutely no significant medical decision making for a concern in this appointment. I have never had this issue before during an annual physical, in which medical hx, concerns, etc. are discussed. Do I have a leg to stand on to appeal this claim, or no? I'm really surprised by this because this has never happened to me before, and I feel like it's a super shady thing to do to a new patient.
