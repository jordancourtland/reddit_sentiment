Original Post: I have Anthem, BCBS. I had an in network surgery a few months ago that i’ve already paid for. In total, the charges have amounted to my entire in network out of pocket max.

For this surgery, I had to travel to a different state due to there only being one surgeon with the required skills within 400 miles.

I was told I could submit a claim to get reimbursed for travel and lodging expenses if they meet the relevant requirements. I documented all travel and lodging, and submitted the claim. I paid in full out of my own pocket for a 30 day airbnb, 2 plane tickets, and a lot of ubers. Everything submitted was in some way related to traveling to a medical office or my place of lodging.

After submitting the claim, 3 “Test ‘Pay to Member’” charges appeared. Each one totaling to the exact amount I requested for reimbursement. 1 was coded with the incorrect year, so it was auto denied. One is still pending. 

Today, one landed. Instead a reimbursement, it is a bill for the entire cost of my trip. That I have already paid for, and was seeking reimbursement for. 

I’m not necessarily asking for advice, I’ve dealt with these… *folks*… before. But if I have to sell my project car to pay for something I already paid for, I’ll be upset to say the least. 

Live laugh love Anthem BCBS.
