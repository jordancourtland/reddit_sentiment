Original Post: I have Atena HMO and had to go tot he ER because I fainted and hit my head. I was given a bunch of tests and discharged the same day. When I went to look up if my insurance had been charged, I saw that the claim was denied because the hospital was out of network, but my EOB states that I owe $0 for the visit? Does anyone know if this will change once the final billing comes out?
