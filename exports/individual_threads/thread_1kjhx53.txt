Original Post: My health and prescription insurance company (via my employer) currently covers a medication I’m taking, but as of July 1, the medication will no longer be covered. I currently have a PA approving coverage of the med (through 12/25), and have yet to receive any information from the insurance company about the end of coverage for the medication. All info has been through my employer HR department. 

Would it be worth it to file an appeal after July 1 to have the medication covered? I’m assuming I’d have to request a refill and have it denied by my insurance company, then go through the appeal process. What’s the likelihood of an appeal working? I have demonstrated an impact of the medication and my provider agrees I should continue taking it. 

And no, I can’t afford to pay out of pocket for it.
