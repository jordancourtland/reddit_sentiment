Original Post: I have medical through my spouse. I added dental through my employer and just discovered that I somehow signed up for medical too, when claims were denied by my spouseâ€™s plan because I now have my own insurance.  Is there any way to get rid of this unneeded and unwanted coverage or am I stuck paying thousands until next year?
