Hi. Young guy so first time navigating health insurance. Aetna is my insurance. I needed a cardiac MRI done and got prior authorization for it. The claim showed up in my app as denied, claiming I don’t have prior authorization for the test. I have the authorization number. On hold with insurance. What’s the likelihood I can get this resolved?
