Original Post: My company uses Aetna and provides fertility coverage through Progyny. Progyny approved an IVF Fresh Cycle that counted toward my tier 2 (65% percent covered, $4800 out of pocket max). I just received an EOB that Aetna denied the egg retrieval and embryo transfer because CPT code S4015 (IVF) is not covered under Aetna. My regular Aetna insurance only covers IUI, but Progyny under Aetna absolutely covers IVF and it plainly states that in the brochure for the 2025 calendar year. The authorization sent to me by Progyny also utilizes that code.

Progyny was a new benefit my company offered as of January 2024. I'm wondering how this possibly could've been denied. Progyny has opened a case and I plan to contact Aetna but if anyone could enlighten me if this was a coding error or some sort of miscommunication between insurance partners, I would be grateful to learn. I received a $13k EOB for services that are plainly states as covered through the Progyny benefit. I have not yet received a bill.
