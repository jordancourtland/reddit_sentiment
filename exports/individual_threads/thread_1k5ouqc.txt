Original Post: Hi!! I don’t understand, but my son had four impacted wisdom teeth removed. My dental insurance said it’s a medical benefit so my medical insurance kicked in. I have hsa. I got my EOB and they denied a few charges. When I called and asked, they couldn’t figure it out and they said well the claim is closed so what you are owed is the $679. 
How is it that my provider charge is so much but my cost is so different? I would’ve expected with an HSA that I would’ve owed the full amount charged since I haven’t met my deductible . This is an in network provider. When I look at the charges, they only allowed for one wisdom tooth extraction cost (vs four )and the contracted amount for the anesthesia.

I’m thinking that eventually this bill will eventually be $3200 due to error?
