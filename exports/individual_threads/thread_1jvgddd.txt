Original Post: My 1 year old, went to urgent care first and then they asked us to take her to emergency as she was having trouble breathing. We went to emergency and her oxygen level was 82%. A chest xray and couple test later she had rhinovirus and bronchitis. She was admitted by the ER doctor to the hospital. My insurance denied the claim because they need more info from doctor, from which doctor ER or the pediatrician that monitored her at the hospital I'm not sure.I have the sydney app it shows the bill for the provider and also shows the plan discount paying the full amount of that bill so my total is 0. Is that pending the doctors note? Not familiar with how plan discounts work, I have blue cross HPN.
