Original Post: I had wisdom teeth surgery last March, which was done quite hastily when the dentist found that my teeth were dangerously close to the nerves. In what was admittedly shady practice, we were made to foot the bill for the day-of procedure. My family and I immediately filed a claim with my provider, which is MetLife PDP Plus, and have yet to be reimbursed. They keep denying the claim and forcing us to refile for basically no reason. What can I do?
