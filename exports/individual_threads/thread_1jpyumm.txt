Original Post: This is new for me. My insurer refuses to disclose the codes - billing, or procedure or any at all. 

They used to be in my claim forms (EOB)  but now they don't include them. When we call they say they aren't allowed to disclose them, and even the descriptions on the claim forms are vague. The one in front of me just says "medical services" next to the date of service plus the dollar amount  

This makes it very hard indeed to appeal a denial 

Is this a new law? A policy? What is going on?
