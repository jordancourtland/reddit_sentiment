Original Post: I went to an appointment at a physician's office, and saw an NP. Lady was nice, checked out a minor medical issue, and sent me on my way with a prescription. Get my insurance claim, and it says "denied." In other words, the physician gets nothing. To be clear, it says I do not owe anything either--this is not about my having to pay anything--it's about the medical provider seemingly scrooged out of their payment. What's the deal here? Is this common practice?
