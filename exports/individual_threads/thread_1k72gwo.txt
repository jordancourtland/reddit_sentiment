Original Post: So I signed up for a first health network insurance plan back in January. I was told I had no deductible and that the specialists I see would be covered with minimal co pay. However, I was informed by the claims department (via NaviClaim) that my plan does not cover "diagnostic testing". I was then told by a First Care rep that they cover up to 70% of a diagnostic testing bill. Then a bill came today asking me for the full amount for a Holter Monitor I had placed. I called billing through that office and they informed me FirstHealth/Naviclaim told them it was "not a covered service" so I am on the hook. This has confused me as I know the same insurance recently denied a CT scan as it was "diagnostic" so I don't know why the holter wasn't denied or covered. I was wondering if anyone else has had similar issues with FirstHealth not covering things. 

TLDR: I'm getting put on the hook for things that I was never told were not covered by my insurance. Am I getting scammed?
