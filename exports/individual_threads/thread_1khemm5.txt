Original Post: I had 4 of my wisdom teeth extracted last February. The total amount was $1,360 and I initially got an estimate to pay $572 as out of pocket (that's excluding the $750 general anesthesia fee not covered by insurance). 3 months later, I got a bill from my provider for another $766! upon calling Aetna, they said that the dental claim was denied because this is considered a medical claim. And the oral surgeon was out of network under medical. But I'm confused how this is a medical claim when it's for my teeth. Does anyone have the same experience?
