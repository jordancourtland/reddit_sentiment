Fit Explanation: The OP is currently dealing with a denial and is seeking a quick resolution, indicating a good fit for the persona.
Original Post: I had a screening mammogram recently that was denied by insurance because of my age. Rather than going through an appeals process, I would like to just resolve this quickly. Would I be able to request the self-pay price for the mammogram from the provider even though they already tried to bill my insurance? Does that matter at all since the claim was denied? Thanks in advance!
