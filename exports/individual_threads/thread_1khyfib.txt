Original Post: I have Cigna health insurance through my employer. In February, I had two different doctors request that I do a cancer gene blood test based off my family history of cancer. They each had me take a detailed survey which indicated I should be tested for the cancer gene and it was a requirement for them to move forward with egg freezing. They noted based on my family history and survey result this would be covered by insurance. If I did have to pay it would be $200. (Results came back negative for me, thank goodness).Fast forward a month+, I received a letter from Cigna that my claim was denied because I am not the ideal family member to test for cancer? Cigna also noted in the claim it was for $6,000 and the patient responsibility is $0.

I am so confused. If I donâ€™t owe anything, who does? Also $6,000 is very different than $200 which I would be okay with paying. 

Do I contest this even though i was denied? Or contact the doctor who had me get tested?
