Original Post: I have been in revenue cycle for 30+ years.  Lets say I have been around the block once or twice.  My question, has anyone ever worked for a doctor that would bill an E/M today and then the incision of a lesion tomorrow + biopsy, when the lesion was removed the same say as the E/M?

I recently went to a dermatologist and this apparently is pretty common for this practice to bill different dates of service so they can 'make extra money'. Per the billing office.  In all of my years, I have never billed this way and I feel it is very illegal.  I was an established patient and there was no extra DX codes to warrant a mod 24 or 25 on the E/M so if he billed the incision on the day it actually happened, he would lose 97.00.

I appealed with the insurance, they said they have no control over his dates of service.  I filed a complaint with fraud and abuse, they denied said they found no evidence(i think he changed his medical records too). I filed with the Atty General's office.  I am not at collections(for the first time in my life) because I refuse to pay the fraudulent claim.  

I wonder what this groups opinion is on changing DOS like this.
