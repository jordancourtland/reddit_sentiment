Original Post: My dental insurance approved invisalign to correct bunching of my teeth in August 2024. I was responsible for 50% of the treatment cost. I paid that up front. Now I find out they are denying payment in 2025. It turns out my dentist office bills monthly and apparently my coverage changed in 2025 to only allow coverage for young adults, and I am above the age threshold.

  
This is a 2000$ bill I was not expecting. I honestly don't how this happened, I had no idea that my dental office would bill monthly so I feel blindsided. My dental office tried appealing on my behalf, with no success. Do you think I'll be successful in appealing or am I stuck?
