Original Post: I (30f) have the misfortune of having Medica insurance. (US based)

I had gone into my primary for possible kidney stones. (I've had them before)

The did a CT but insurance denied my claim saying it wasn't medically necessary and I should have gotten an ultrasound instead. 

It's my understanding that ultrasounds are not as reliable at detecting kidney stones as CTs and every time I've had them in the past involved a CT.

What would you recommend as next steps? 

I filed a second appeal, but I want all my ducks in a row.
