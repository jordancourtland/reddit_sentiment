Thank you all for your helpful comments. The insurance has accepted his claim—I'm still unsure how, but I believe persistence was key. Spending a lot of time on the phone, sending emails, and being willing to fight for it paid off

Hi everyone,

We’re dealing with a frustrating situation regarding my husband’s upcoming surgery, and I’m hoping for some advice or insights.

My husband has a severely deviated septum and both internal and external nasal valve collapse, significantly affecting his breathing. His CT scan even shows a fracture, though he never went to A&amp;E. His ENT specialist recommended a septorhinoplasty to fix these issues and mentioned the need for grafts due to the severity of the deformity.

Here’s the problem:

* The insurance denied coverage, claiming part of the procedure is "cosmetic, and they accept he had a trauma," despite the medical necessity.
* We already knew the surgeon’s fee wasn’t fee-assured, so we were prepared to pay about 50% of the costs ourselves.
* The insurance won’t even cover the hospital costs, and the doctor isn’t comfortable changing the procedure code to "septoplasty" and billing part of it separately for insurance purposes.

Adding to our frustration, our insurance premiums increased 25% this year, even though we’ve never made a claim. We’re questioning whether it’s worth keeping this insurance if they won’t cover something so clearly necessary.

Has anyone been in a similar situation? Is there any way to appeal the insurance’s decision or find a workaround?

Thank you in advance for your help!
