Original Post: Hi all,  
I’m hoping for advice on appealing a claim denial — this is my first time dealing with something like this.

I purchased **Patriot America Plus** from **IMG** in **February 2025** for my parents, who are visiting the U.S. for 6 months. In **April 2025**, I had to take my mom to an urgent primary care visit due to **sudden stomach and abdominal pain**.

During the visit, the doctor took vitals and noticed elevated blood pressure (which was a **first-time occurrence**). He ordered **blood work**, and due to some irregularities, later requested an **abdominal ultrasound**, which revealed **gallstones** — also never previously known.

The doctor’s visit summary lists the **primary diagnosis as “Upper Abdominal Pain (R10.10)”**, not hypertension. The provider, the lab for blood work, and the imaging center were all **in-network**.

We paid:

* A **$30 copay** for the blood work
* **$740 upfront** for the ultrasound, which we were told counted toward the **$1000 deductible**

All providers told us the remaining charges should be covered by the insurance.

However, I recently began receiving **statements from all the providers** showing that nearly **nothing was covered** by insurance. I checked my IMG account and saw the following **denials**:

* $550 for the doctor’s visit
* $470 for the blood work
* $1500 for the ultrasound

**Denial Reasons:**

* **T04**: The following is considered a Pre-existing Condition which is not covered under your policy: *ESSENTIAL PRIMARY HYPERTENSION*
* **PX2**: The following is considered a Pre-existing Condition which is not covered under your policy: *UPPER ABDOMINAL PAIN, UNSPECIFIED*

These reasons don't make sense, since:

* **She had never been diagnosed or treated for hypertension** before this visit — it was discovered incidentally during the checkup.
* The **visit summary** from the doctor includes the following:
   * *“Her blood pressure was slightly elevated upon arrival, although she reports no history of hypertension.”*
   * *“History reviewed. No pertinent past medical history. No pertinent surgical history.”*
   * *“Hypertension: New onset”*
   * *“No history of similar pain, and no recent medication.”*

Has anyone successfully appealed a situation like this with **IMG** or a similar visitor insurance plan?  
Any tips or experience would really help — I’m completely lost and don’t want this to end up costing thousands out of pocket.

Thanks in advance!
