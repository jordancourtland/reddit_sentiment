Original Post: long story short, I lost my insurance in October through my husband. He is now re-employed but also on medicare and his new company cannot get me insurance.  I have basic preventative insurance through a temp agency I do some work for but no hospital coverage. I tried through a broker to get insurance, but United Health care denied me due to taking meds for high blood pressure and cholesterol and previously having a hyperthyroid.  I cannot do obamacare due to not being open enrollment.    I just want hospital/catastrophic coverage.  I fell yesterday for the innovative solutions , where they said it was gap insurance from Aetna (up to 3 years). They were honest about the first 30 days  I cannot use, but I am afraid that from what I am reading , they will not pay for anything going forward.   

Bottom line is that I need health insurance until open enrollment, and going private I got denied from UNH. Should I try Cigna?  Is the policy from innovative really a scam in that if I do get hospitalized and go to the doctor they will not cover anything?  What are my other choices.
