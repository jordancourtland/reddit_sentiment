Original Post: I am pregnant and got genetic testing. The fetal medicine doctor's office told us that the tests would not be covered by our insurance and would cost us between $250-700 out of pocket. However, I was looking over my insurance claims today and noticed that there was a claim for $9k that was denied by insurance.

This was the genetic testing, done through Natera... what can I do about this? We did talk to an insurance specialist before doing the tests that assured us the self-pay cost was $250-700. I just googled the usual cost for this testing and the self-pay cost should be between $250 and 600 according to the internet...

I don't know who to talk to about this and am stunned/ panicking because this is all of my savings (which I was going to use to pay for the other maternity bills -- we have a deductible of about 6k).

Thanks for your help.
