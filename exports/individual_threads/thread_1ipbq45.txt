Original Post: Hey everyone,

I’m in a tough situation and hoping for some guidance or advice from anyone who has experience dealing with health insurance denials, ERISA claims, or bad faith insurance practices.

I have employer-provided insurance through Aetna, and they are wrongfully denying my medically necessary hip surgery despite overwhelming medical evidence.

I injured my right hip in June 2024 while sprinting. My MRI confirmed a complete labral tear, femoroacetabular impingement (FAI), and a displaced labrum. My surgeon determined that surgery is required after I failed all conservative treatments including physical therapy, medications, and pain management. Armor Physical Therapy provided a letter stating PT will not help my condition, yet Aetna denied my claim, saying I haven’t completed six weeks of PT. Aetna also refused to reschedule a peer-to-peer review after my provider missed the original call, blocking any further discussion.

Aetna denied my initial claim on January 15 and my Level 1 Appeal on February 4. I filed a complaint with the Michigan Department of Insurance and Financial Services (DIFS) on February 6, and Aetna has until March 8 to respond. My Level 2 Appeal is currently pending, but I am expecting more pushback. I have reached out to attorneys who handle bad faith insurance and ERISA cases, but I am struggling to find one who will take my case.

I need help figuring out what to do next. Has anyone successfully fought Aetna on a similar denial and won? If my Level 2 Appeal is denied, what are my best next steps? Does an external review through DIFS hold any real weight, or should I focus on legal action? If I hire an attorney, should I look for an ERISA lawyer, a bad faith insurance lawyer, or both? Would switching to a new provider help, or will that slow things down even more?

I’m in constant pain, struggling with mobility, and this whole process is taking a serious toll on my mental health. I just want to get the care I need without unnecessary delays. Any guidance or personal experiences would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks in advance.
