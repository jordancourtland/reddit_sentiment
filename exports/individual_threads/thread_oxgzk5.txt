Original Post: Long story short, pre-pandemic,  kiddie dentist "suggested," our 4 yr old to get "surgery" to remove a damaged tooth because above on the gums she got a "lump". Got pre-approved with insurance A, with the letter and everything to go ahead and will be covered bla bla bla.

The surgery last 4 hours and was a success. Had not 1, but a total of 4 upper jaw front teeth were removed. Holy crap, this was more than what we expected. Kiddie's dentist explained this was unavoidable.

Fast forward 60 days after surgery, got a bill in the mail from Anesthesiest wanting $4,000.00. Show the bill to insurance A. Insurance A, comes back, we discovered your daughter has some coverage on Insurance B? All costs of surgery were denied.

Apparently, I have family coverage by Job on insurance B, which was not activated for dental, thus no coverage. Insurance B, further denies claim base on "30 days" past since day of operation, bill not received on time. Denied. (At this point insurances are a scam)

Now about 1 1/2 years later, I got a $4,000.00 bill through "collections" and they basically refused to negotiate. Asked for an itemized invoice, still received lump sum $4000.00 for CPT00170. 

What are my options?

To me, this was so wrong on so many levels.
