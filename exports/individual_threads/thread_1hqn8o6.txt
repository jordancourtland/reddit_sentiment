Original Post: Hi, I had a pain that my regular doctor wanted checked out with ultrasound.  I was given a referral to local hospital for ultrasound and everyone at my Doctor's office and at the Hospital Ultrasound Department assured me it was "in-network".  Months later I get the bill and ignore it (thinking United will cover it), then later find that its not fully covered.

I appealed with United and they denied my first appeal "decision upheld".

The 3rd notice to pay say due date is today 12/31/2024

What are my next steps to fighting this?
