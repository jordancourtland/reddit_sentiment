Original Post: Hello,

I need some knee surgery and the prior authorization was denied.   A day before my surgery, the surgeon's PA had a peer to peer call and said it was approved, but the UHC website did not confirm this.   I checked this morning, just prior to my surgery and still only the denial was listed.   The provider gave me the auth number but UHC staff said it was not a proper authorization number and it did not pull anything up in their system.    Out of fear, I decided to cancel my appointment which didn't go well with the provider as my procedure was time sensitive.   All UHC could tell me was to contact my provider.    The PA told me he had the number they gave him but he did not document the call in my record.   It sound like CPT codes were wrong.   

  
It seemed like a big gamble going into surgery without a documented prior auth for a 60k surgery.    Especially with the horror stories others have reported about UHC denying claims.   I just checked and there is no preauthorization on the website.     

Feeling like I screwed up canceling and should have trusted my provider's work.   I feel like it has soured the relationship.
