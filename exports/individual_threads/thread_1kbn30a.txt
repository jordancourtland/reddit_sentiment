Original Post: Other than the GEHA website and customer service phone number, does anyone know how to contact a warm body at GEHA?

Here are the problems:

Ever since late Dec 2024, when GEHA redid its website, neither my friend nor I have been able to login.  Yes we made the new login data and no, the website just goes to a blank page.  Nothing like this ever happened to either of us before the GEHA changes.  The phone people are useless too. 

Issue 01:  We need some way to contact a person who is competent.  We need someone to resolve this login problem.

Also, each time we call regarding claims, the answers change.  

- First time, they were processing. 

- Second time, they were denied due to filing late even though I have a copy of the original filing in front of me, and it is well within the alleged 6 month deadline.

- Third time, they canâ€™t even find the fucking claims when provided with the claim numbers and dates of service.

Issue 02:  We need someone competent enough to review the many documents we previously mailed.

Does anyone have any suggestions?
