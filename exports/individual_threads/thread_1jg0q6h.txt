Original Post: Hello friends! Before going in for a service (general anesthesia), I received a sample bill from the anesthesiologist (Colorado) who let me know that 1) they will not be submitting claims to my insurance and I have to pay for services fully at the day of service 2) suggested to reach out to my insurance provider to inquire details of reimbursement based on the billing codes and amounts stated in the sample bill they provided. I spoke with my insurance company - BCBS of MS (provided the codes, types of service, reason for service, etc.) and was told that based on the billing codes, type of service and my benefits, I will need to submit a self-claim after the fact and I will be reimbursed 85%. My self-claim gets denied and after 1 hour on the phone with the insurance company (very helpful representative!) I am told that these codes are not covered under my plan after all. I did my due diligence to inquire on the coverage ahead of services because I would consider other options/providers if I found out that they are not covered, so if I was provided false information (codes did not change) and made decisions based on the false information, I feel like I should be reimbursed by my insurance company (at least in a considerable way). Has anyone dealt with a similar situation? How can I fight for myself? Any tips/guidance are super appreciated!
