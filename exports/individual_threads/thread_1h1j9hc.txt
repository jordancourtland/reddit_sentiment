Original Post: Long story short my husband was in an accident in October 2023 where he crashed on his bicycle and someone else called 911 when they found him unconscious in the street and am ambulance took him to the hospital. We live in California. According to our health insurance claims (we are no longer enrolled with the same company) all of the claims were "finalized" December 27, 2023. We received many bills in the mail of which we sent to our insurance but never saw anything from the ambulance company. There was a claim for the ambulance company that appeared on its own and was finalized that says "patient responsibility" is $0 with "out of network" listed next to it.  I am really curious as to why are we receiving a bill of which we have NEVER seen over a year later? Is this allowed in California? Do we have to pay this?!? We have already paid so many medical bills and thought this was behind us. Any advice is appreciated thank you.

UPDATE: called the ambulance company and they were useless (F U FALCK) but we did appeal the claim through our insurance and we just got a letter sent to us saying our appeal was approved and they covered the bill üôåüèº
