Original Post: Hi all,
Hoping someone here can help me make sense of this or share advice on next steps.

I recently had a BRCA genetic test done through Labcorp. Before the test, I received an estimate of $43.17 and got pre-authorization from Anthem. Everything looked good, so I went ahead.

Now I’ve received an EOB from Anthem denying the claim. They say I’ve reached my “once per lifetime” limit for BRCA testing—and they’re expecting me to pay $3,000 out-of-pocket.

I called Anthem, and they said the correct CPT codes were used and the denial is based solely on the lifetime limit. But I have never had BRCA testing before. It’s my first time. Anthem is now reviewing the case, but I’m trying to understand what might have gone wrong.

My theory is that their system may have logged the pre-authorization itself as a completed test, and when the actual test was billed, it triggered the “second” test denial. Has anyone seen something like this happen?

Thanks in advance!
