Original Post: Hi,

A provider I saw over a year ago is trying to bill me for medical bills that Medicare denied the claim for due to timely. I reached out to Medicare and they wrote me a letter saying I am only responsible for 20% copay of the contracted amount. I reached out to the provider and they were unrelenting so I wrote a letter to Medicare asking them for help. A few months later Medicare wrote to me that they reached out to the provider and send me a copy of the letter they sent them, however, the provider is still sending me past due notices for the full amount and has not send me any response about Medicareâ€™s letter.  

I need help to prevent them from coming after me and reporting me to the credit bureaus. Please help!
