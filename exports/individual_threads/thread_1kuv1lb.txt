Original Post: Good morning. February 2024 I had a cancerous tumor removed at MGH in Boston. I was an NH resident at the time, my providers facility partners with MGH for thoracic surgery. 

Three months ago I received notice from MGH that my insurer has denied the claim due to the procedure being completed out of state. They sent documentation asking me to allow them to appeal on my behalf. 

I am now receiving calls from their billing department stating that my bill is overdue. I asked if they have completed the appeals process: the billing department states that they do not know. 

I’m wondering how best to proceed. I’m concerned about interrupting the appeal, acknowledging a need to pay, etc.

Insurance is employer based and has historically been fantastic in the 10+ years I’ve had it. 

I’d appreciate any advice, thanks in advance.
