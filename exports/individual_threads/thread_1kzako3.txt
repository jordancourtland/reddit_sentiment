Original Post: Hi! I recently visited another state (Illinois) and got a concussion there (my home state is Texas). I don't currently have insurance, but went to the ER to get a CT scan and make sure it wasn't anything more serious. 

The hospital told me that the only way they would be able to lower my bill is if I am able to apply for a marketplace-esque policy in Texas and get denied. Does anyone have advice/experience getting prior act(?) coverage for something like this? Is it even worth it, or should I just suck it up and get the hospital payment plan?

EDIT: Thanks for all the helpful (and not so helpful) responses! 
Disclaimer: I definitely am not the most literate when it comes to insurance, hence not understanding what my options are. Based on y’all’s advice, I’ll look into getting Medicaid going forward and start a payment plan for the er bill.
