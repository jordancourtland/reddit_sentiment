Original Post: I got an approval for an MRI and soon after I received a call from Evicore, who claimed to be calling on behalf of Johns Hopkins, where my doctor is located.  They asked me several medical questions related to my pain, which I answered, believing they were with my doctor's office. Then they offered me information on alternatives to "invasive medical procedures like MRI". This seemed sketchy and inaccurate. I looked them up and realized that they were being dishonest about their affiliation to obtain PHI and were contracted by Priority Partners, owned by Hopkins.

Now I've gotten a denial letter for my MRI by Evicore. This seems like a blatant violation of HIPAA. I was not aware they were misrepresenting themselves to mislead me into giving PHI to build a case to deny me.  There was no informed consent.

Priority Partners is already in hot water and has suspended accreditation. I would like to know if these are reportable offenses and advice on how to proceed. I'd like to escalate this as far as I can because they must be doing this to numerous people and it seems predatory and unethical.
