Original Post: I (25, MI, ~41.6k yearly income) foolishly chose US Health Group/ Freedom Life insurance. I canceled the plan after a few months but basically they denied all four claims including an MRI scan, my total bill is around $6k. I'm trying to send over an internal appeal and they are giving me the absolute runaround. I already faxed the appeal with the EOB attached last week and now they're saying it is not on file because it has to go to consumer affairs, not the claims department. Which goes against every thing I was advised to do in a previous call. 

Now a supervisor is telling me to send over my appeal to them so they can forward it to "consumer affairs" because that department doesnt have a direct line. 

It's been terrible. All I'm really waiting for is for them to deny (or hopefully, accept my appeal) so I can file an external appeal.

I fee like they are purposefully giving their clients the runaround. 

Has anyone successfully gotten USHG to pay for a claim after it was denied? Please PM me!

UPDATE,ETA: this past year was a blur, I had to let go of a job and other slew of things. Basically, I checked my medical records for the hospital and I did complain of the ringing in my ear since the last four months (from the date of the appointment), the doctor stated that I "present for pulsatile tinnitus" so I was experiencing the ringing before coverage. So the details of my appeal were off a bit. I don't know if that Changes things. I'm pretty sure it does. I suppose I will have to send over another, updated, appeal with the correct dates.
