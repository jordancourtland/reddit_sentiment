Original Post: Hi everyone. Sorry I am new to health insurance as I recently moved to the US.

Had a dermatology appointment after I was referred by my PCP for excessive sweating. During the appointment, most of the time was spent on my complaint of excessive sweating. After it was taken care of, the dermatologist asked me if I had any other things I want to talk about and I mentioned that I’m taking medication for hairloss prescribed from somewhere else and I’d like to transfer my prescription.

I just got an email from insurance telling me that my claim for that dermatology visit is denied and I have to pay the full cost of it ($613) because my plan does not cover hair loss! How can I go about this when the main reason for the visit was not even the hair loss?
