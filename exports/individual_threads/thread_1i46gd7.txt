Original Post: Hello everyone, I need advice on how to handle an issue related to my health insurance.

In May 2024, I went to the ER. When the hospital sent me the bill, I filed a claim with my insurance company (ISI Insurance). During this time, I regularly checked in with the insurance company about the status of the claim, and they kept telling me they were waiting for the hospital to provide my medical records before they could proceed. At no point did they mention the 180-day deadline for resolving the claim, nor did they advise me to contact the hospital myself.

Later on, when I followed up again, they told me to contact the hospital to request the medical records. I did so and sent the records to the insurance company. However, they denied my claim, saying it was past the deadline, and told me to submit an appeal letter explaining the situation. I wrote the appeal, but they found every reason to deny it again and refuse to cover the bills.

I’m at a loss for what to do next. I’d really appreciate any advice or guidance on how to handle this situation. Thank you so much!
