Original Post: I had a minor medical procedure last month. The hospital where this happened pre verified all codes with my ppo provider (bcbs) and none of them required a pre approval. I separately went through the maze to get all the codes and reverified all of the codes that were given by the hospital with the insurance. I (and my insurance) was given an estimated quote of 80k $, but after the procedure I was only given a total bill (hospital+doctor) of ~50k $.

The procedure went very smooth, and nothing adverse happened requiring any additional attention. A couple of weeks ago i called insurance and realized they had used a different code from the one that didnt need preapproval and apparently this new code needed a preapproval. The insurance said they will still consider it depending on the medical records and history. But i am worried the insurance might deny my claim. Is there a way to hold the hospital accountable for this change? Fortunately I have not paid any money out of pocket yet; but the possible liability could be huge (~50k). I would also not meet my out of pocket maximum, which would have significantly helped me and my family throughout the year. 

Is there anything I can do in this situation except wait and watch?
