Original Post: I'm worried because I received a bill from a clinic for something I had already paid the remaining out of pocket 6 months ago, then I received an EOB from my insurance saying that they're taking back everything they paid because they were not primary at the time (I had another insurance for 2 months), the bill is for $4,000 approximately.  I've submitted the claims myself to the "primary" but will they really cover outside of timely claims? I was told at first that I was only 10 days out of timely but now they're telling me that's around 3 months because the provider was in network, I've been calling to have my case reviewed but they keep telling that I have to wait till the claims are processed but I know it will be denied per outside of timely, what can I do? Any advise?
