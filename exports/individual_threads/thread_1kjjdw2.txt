Original Post: We had a baby 2 weeks ago and spent 2 days in the hospital with no NICU stay. Today I received emails about explanation of benefits and saw that the insurance has billed us $35000 for the baby claiming that the person is not an eligible dependent. I  reached out to my employer last week and finished the formalities to add the baby to my insurance. I’m not sure if that has been processed. My query is once the formalities of adding the baby to the insurance are completed, will the insurance cover the said cost because $35000 is a huge amount for us. I also received another bill in the mail where the insurance denied covering the NICU charge but I’m not sure why the hospital even billed that because the baby never went to the NICU. 

If anyone has experience about the same, please share your insights. 

Thank you
