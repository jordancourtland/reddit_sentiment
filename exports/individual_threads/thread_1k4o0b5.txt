Original Post: Sorry if this is the wrong place for this, or the wrong tag, but I just needed some assistance, I am 26 years old and on March 17th of this year I lost my health insurance that I was on under my parents, however I am so clueless about how anything works regarding health insurance, I tried Googling and talking to my family about what a deductible is and it still confuses me so I don't really get how that works. I also have a lot of mental health issues that have caused me to not work jobs that provide health insurance so all my income at the moment is from uber, which I'm working to change at some point.

I have medications I take daily that I soon won't have and won't be able to afford to get more, my linzess will cost 600 bucks everytime I pick it up and my doctor wants me to start ozempic soon, any financial assistance plan denies me because I have a trust fund of about 50k from when my mother passed away, that I'd really like to keep so I can maybe put a down payment on a house at some point down the road. So does anyone have any ideas on what I can do or how I can get covered or who I can talk to, to get some assistance. I'm willing to pay monthly for coverage I just don't even know how to go about beginning this process.
