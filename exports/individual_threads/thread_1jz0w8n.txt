Original Post: Hi all,
I’m hoping someone here can offer advice or guidance because I’m at my wit’s end. I work for a health insurance company and have health insurance through my employer. I cover both myself and my husband under this plan.

For some reason, every single claim submitted for my husband gets denied with the reason: “At the time we processed this claim, the dependent didn’t show as eligible under your plan.”

This started happening last year, and it took 3–4 months of back-and-forth just to get several claims reprocessed correctly. Now the same thing is happening again. My husband recently had a string of doctor visits due to ongoing health issues, and once again, all his claims are being denied for the same “ineligible” reason.

I’ve called the number on the back of our ID card at least 6 times over the past 2–3 months. Each time I’m told my husband is showing as eligible and that they will send the claims back for reprocessing — which never happens.

A few weeks ago, a rep told me they discovered a box hadn’t been checked on his eligibility (?!), but that it was now fixed and future claims should process correctly. Well, he had two more appointments after that, and the new claims are still being denied for the exact same reason.

I called again this morning, and the rep couldn’t explain the issue, just said they would send the claims back for reprocessing again, and that if it keeps happening, they could escalate it.

This is incredibly frustrating. My husband has ongoing health concerns and will need regular appointments, and I’m terrified this is going to continue indefinitely. I feel like I’m stuck in a loop of calling, being reassured, and then nothing actually getting resolved.

What should I do at this point? Is there anyone specific I should be asking for or a process I should demand be followed? Is this something that can/should be escalated to HR or another department? I need to get this fixed for good and can’t keep chasing every claim. Any advice is very much appreciated.
