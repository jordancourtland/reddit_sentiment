Original Post: I recently went to the obgyn to get a birth control implant that is 100% covered under my insurance policy.

When making the appointment I requested an in network doctor appointment with my regular obgyn office and was scheduled with an in network Nurse Practitioner.

Apparently upon billing, an out of network doctor that I never met or knew was signing off on my care ended up being the name on my billing so the claim was denied and I received a bill for $2,000.

I am pretty frustrated that I asked for an in network doctor and an out of network doctor who I never met or consented to giving me care ended up on my chart and is now making my visit out of network.

I had a conference call with billing and aetna and was told to file a claim with aetna which I plan to do.

I am pretty upset with my doctors office for not respecting my request for an in network doctor and have lost a lot of trust in St Lukes as a result. I am concerned that the appeal will be denied when the blame technically falls on the St Lukes for not respecting my in network request and having an out of network doctor that I never met signing off on my medical forms without my knowledge or consent.

Has anyone else ever encountered this type of situation before?
