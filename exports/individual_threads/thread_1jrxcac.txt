Original Post: I have been dealing with new health issues and it’s freaking me out. I was previously on medicaid under my mother but became ineligible after I turned 19. I cannot enroll for myself because I was denied twice already for other reasons/don’t meet this “qualification.” Before that happened, I was with a provider who ordered a scan for me that showed something but I had to cancel the appointment after losing coverage. 

My mother then unfortunately put me under a plan under UHC but after I started having issues with them (plus all the things that’s been said about them in general), I’m thinking I should look for another. 

I’m not sure where to go from here though because it’s passed the enrollment deadline since a while ago and I do not meet any of the special circumstances to enroll. Both of my parents are on medicaid so that’s not an option for me anymore. 

(for context I am 20F in college, currently don’t work a job, and from Illinois)
