Original Post: Hello all,

I recently separated from the National Guard where I had TRICARE. About a year ago I had gotten a new debit card that caused a lapse in payment on my account. Without warning/ informing me, TRICARE dropped my policy.

I have a full time civilian job that has now denied my claim for a health insurance appeal, due to the fact that I have not had insurance for longer than 30 days.

This appeal was a full page explaining my military service and coverage, mixup with payment that caused my loss of coverage, and my surprise to find out I had been dropped.

I have never had to use my insurance, I am 25, active, and healthy. Yet, they denied me coverage.

Does anyone have recommendations for good, affordable coverage for a single, 25yo, male, not a smoker, exercise daily?

Thank you.
