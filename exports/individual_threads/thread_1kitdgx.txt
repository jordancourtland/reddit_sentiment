Original Post: I’m dealing with something incredibly frustrating and dangerous right now, and I wanted to share it in case others have faced this too.

I’m HIV-negative and have been prescribed Emtricitabine/Tenofovir (generic Truvada) as PrEP for HIV prevention — which, under the Affordable Care Act (ACA), is supposed to be covered without cost-sharing.

Back in February 2025, I had a one-time PEP prescription after a high-risk situation. Ever since, Aetna has been wrongly treating my PrEP prescription as if it’s HIV treatment instead of prevention. They’ve been charging me a $10 co-pay and denying proper coverage, even though my doctor has called their prior authorization line multiple times to confirm it’s for preventive care.

I’ve filed two appeals, submitted letters from my doctor, and explained that I’m HIV-negative and taking PrEP to stay that way. The agents I’ve spoken with barely seem to understand what PrEP is for and keep defaulting to inaccurate classifications.

This is not just a billing issue — it’s a bad faith insurance practice and a direct violation of ACA preventive care mandates. If I lose access to this medication because of their negligence and end up contracting HIV, the consequences would be life-changing.

I’ve filed a complaint with my state’s Department of Insurance and plan to report them to HHS too, but it’s exhausting having to fight this hard for basic, federally-mandated preventive care.

If anyone else has been through something similar or has advice on what else I can do, I’d really appreciate it. No one should have to deal with this.
