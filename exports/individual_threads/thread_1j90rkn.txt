Original Post: I got my wisdom teeth out recently and before my appointment, I called the insurance company to ask if this dentist was in-network. The agent confirmed that the dentist is indeed in-network, so I proceeded with the treatment. When I checked the claim today, I saw that the dentist was marked as out-of network. 

Has anyone else experienced something like this?
