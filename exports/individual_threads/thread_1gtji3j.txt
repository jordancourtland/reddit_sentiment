Original Post: I received a denial claim (for my daughter) from my insurance.  My daughter is 14 years old and decided to experiment with marijuana.   I found this out when at the hospital after doing many tests b/c she was physically unable to communicate.   From the insurance letter, they said the claims were denied because the level of care wasn't medically necessary.   I am appealing this as the bill is too large for us to bear and thank god that she is in better health now and will never touch drugs again.  Could someone help guide me if I am including the correct information or if I need to add any other doc. to support my appeal?  Below links for the EOB, on page 2 &amp; 3 are the main charges of concern.

I am writing regarding my claim ID #:---------  for the amount $12,360.32 for my daughter's treatment at Golisano Children's Hospital of SWFL. I would like to appeal the denied expenses for the reasons stated below.

On Oct. 25th, I received a call from my daughter’s school that she was vomiting.  When I arrived at the school, an ambulance had already been called.  I took my daughter, ---------, in the ambulance to the emergency room for vomiting, unconscious, having no physical communication, and declining state of health. Due to the doctor's concern for her being seriously ill, many different tests were ordered.  After consulting the doctor, it was decided she should be admitted to ICU and stay the night due to her declining health and be closely monitored.  (1) My daughter had low blood pressure and needed close monitoring.  (2) She needed a machine to help her with her breathing because she had low oxygen levels. (3) She was exposed to a drug that caused damage to her body.  (4) Her mental health was in question and required care in the hospital.  My daughter ended up being admitted for 1 night and was discharged from the hospital on Oct. 26th.

I have not been told by the staff at The Golisano Children's Hospital of SWFL that many of the proceeders were not covered by my insurance. I would of forgo these tests, had I known this information.  At the time, I was watching my daughter receive multiple bags of IVs, catheters, and tests.  Her overall health was my utmost concern.  I was in a heightened emotional state and figuring out whether the procedures were covered or not covered was the furthest thing from my mind.

I ask that this claim please be reviewed again and that my statement above be taken into account. Had I known that most of the procedures were not covered by my insurance, I would have declined services.  It is too late now. We are a one-income, low-income family that will be severely financially burdened by this bill if it is not otherwise reduced.  This situation was an **emergency**.  Please know that this situation was **out of my control** and requesting that you process the claim under my in-network benefits.

Thank you for taking the time to review and consider my appeal. If you have any questions, please contact me at the number listed below.  Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,

Name &amp; Signature
