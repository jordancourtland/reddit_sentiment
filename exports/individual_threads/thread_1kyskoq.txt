\-Aetna denied OON coverage based on in network availability to original prior auth and listed two IN providers. At no point have I been denied medical necessity. 

\-I contacted both providers, neither practiced or treated the disease. I submitted a first level appeal with this information.

\-The first level appeal was denied, just restating "IN providers available"

\-I called Aetna and a representative confirmed no other providers showed on the list and **instructed** me to file a second level appeal. I filed this appeal based on confirmation I would have no others to appeal 

\-I submitted this appeal with a copy of email confirmation from the office of the unavailable providers. 

\-The denial to the second level appeal again restated that provider I had just sent the email of. 

\-I talked to a representative that escalated this with the review team. The review team **did** acknowledge the mistake and provided a list of two **new** providers, contrary to what the rep that encouraged me to submit the appeal said. This list was given informally over the phone and through the message portal. It included instructions to "contact pre cert for a network deficiency should these be unsuitable."

\-I contacted these providers and have in writing that they cannot treat me. I called pre cert and they refused to file the deficiency based on appeals exhausted.
