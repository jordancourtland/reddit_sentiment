Original Post: Hi,

I found out after my insurance didn't approve more visits for PT as not medically necessary the internal appeal the PT office uses with the insurance allows them to submit the letter of medical necessity and request for an appeal. Weeks went by after giving them the letter of medical necessity and request for the appeal. The insurance just straight up froze it the PT office claims and didn't deny or accept the appeal request. What do you do when they just don't respond? I'm in NY for reference. I was private paying in the meantime for PT. The authorizations person was shocked. On their end they couldn't do anything they claimed except try to open a new request? 

They previously repeatedly by default state not medically necessary for everything from PT to MRI's until a peer to peer is done. Is this just a tactic to deny coverage? For example prior to this had an MRI deemed not medically necessary switched insurance to this and it was approved showing a hernia! Are there no repercussions for insurance companies arbitrarily denying coverage? 

The local insurance broker for this insurance claimed they were good at providing PT as long as it was needed well they straight up ignored that letter. I feel like I was lied to. Coincidentally I just hit my out of pocket maximum then additional PT denial. 

The NY State attorney General office has I kid you not one guy and last time took over 6 months to review a complaint when falsely sent to collections by a medical group despite EOB showing $0 owed by my insurer so that option doesn't hold much weight. 

Any help would be appreciated.
