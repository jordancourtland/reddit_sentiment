Original Post: Hi everyone, just received an email today from cigna denying a claim of over $100k, submitted by rwj for my recent oncologic surgery. The reason stated was that they requested additional information from the provider but didnt receive it, so the claim was closed. Before surgery, I contacted both to ask whether pa was required. I was told the surgery was considered outpatient, so no PA was needed (and any situation that might arise later tey would convert the request into inpatient admission). After surgery I had elevated hr, severe pain and hadn't eaten so the doctors delayed my discharge for some hours more (stayed around 36 hours in the hospital). Curiously, i later received two PA letters dated after my procedure: one approved outpatient care and another denied inpatient care. When contacted after surgery both parties stated that they're waiting the other to send something making me frustated with this situation. Any advice or similar stories would be huge right now. Thank you!
