Original Post: So I just received a bill from over a year ago. I called the hospital and they said that they were hacked and didn’t send out any billing until recently. I checked my claims and it was denied because it wasn’t submitted within a year of service. I’m going to appeal once I get the claim paperwork in the mail but is there anything that I can do to not pay it since it is the hospitals fault? My deductible and out of pocket was reached that year.
