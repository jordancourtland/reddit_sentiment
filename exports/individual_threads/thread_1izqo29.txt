Original Post: So, my husband didn't open his mail (I know) so we didn't see that his company was requesting verification to continue coverage on our daughter.

At the same time, I lost my insurance benefits through my job so I will be added to my husband's insurance.

We have filed an appeal regarding the insurance for our daughter and backdating it, but my question is, if it's denied, will we be able to add my daughter effective the date I'm added since we are making a change?

Thanks in advance!
