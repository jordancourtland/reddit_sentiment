Original Post: Hi, Just wondering if anyone has any advice here. My BCBS Anthem plan is denying $75k worth of claims, stating that the service is a non-covered benefit... but it is? Air ambulance and the hcpcs codes billed (A0431 and A0436) are covered benefits. I seemingly meet the criteria for coverage as well unless something wasn't documented. I developed HELLP syndrome and Pre-E (making me a high risk pregnancy one of the qualifying diagnoses). I was taken by air ambulance to a hospital roughly an hour away by vehicle  because I needed a level one trauma center and the hospital I was at was not equipped to provide the services I needed. This was also the closest level one trauma center. I was told multiple times by the hospital that I almost died. The Air Ambulance Service appealed the denial and they were denied, they recommended I appeal which I did. I'm confused by the language presented in the denial. I could understand if they were denying due to it not being medically necessary but to say it's a non-covered benefit entirely? When it says that it is covered in my benefit booklet and I have reference numbers from member services confirming it is? What am I missing? Should I be calling the admitting hospital and requesting a CMN? I want my ducks in a row if they try denying my appeal. Has this happened to everyone else? Also - will I really be on the hook for the $75k? I barely make half of that a year. Will the air ambulance services reduce the cost and allow a payment plan? What happens in case of denials with large sums?
