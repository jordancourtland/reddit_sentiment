Original Post: BCBS denied ambulance claim because apparently they do not cover ambulance calls without transport to hospital!! Where does it say in the coverage? I had a family member take me to the ER because I was worried about a huge bill. They covered my ER visit but not the ambulance call. 

Is this just an example of insurance looking for a reason NOT to pay?!
