Original Post: HI all, 

I was recently diagnosed with ADHD and began taking a low dose of Vyvanse. My doctor informed me that their policy was to do a routine drug test twice a year since it is a controlled substance. I went in for this test 6 weeks ago and never heard anything back or received any test results. Now I received an explanation of benefits in the mail from my insurance saying the claim is denied for being out of network, and I am responsible for **$2,319**. I'm being charged for 27 separate tests, each costing $69-150. I assumed this would be a basic routine test like for a job that might cost like $50 total. I am a middle aged mom with absolutely no history of drug abuse or crime or anything that would be a red flag. 

What recourse do I have here? I have contacted my doctor to see if she actually ordered this absurd array of tests and to ask why the test was not sent to my in-network lab provider like all my other labs. Freaking out here. Here is the ridiculous list of tests:
