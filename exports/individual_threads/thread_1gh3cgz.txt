Original Post: My daughter is diagnosed with Angelman Syndrome and Autism in Texas. My husband works for a company that has a self-funded insurance (EMI). They are deny her more than 20 therapy visits due to her disability. I’ll post the email sent below. 

What options do I have to fight this? 

Your appeal was heard and denied on Thursday.  The letter should answers a lot of your questions, but I will give you more detail.  Habilitation is an exclusion of the policy.  The policy states:

 

37. Care or treatment of learning disorders, intellectual disabilities, or chronic organic

 brain syndrome, except services required to diagnose any of the above.

 

The multiple diagnosis codes and how it works is explained within the letter.   I have remarked your daughter’ family notes in detail for our customer service representatives so we are all on the same page. 

 

Here are the claims that we have received and paid .  There are 4 claims that will be denied for over the plan maximum.  Those dates are 10/10/24, 10/11/24, 10/17/2024 and 10/18/2024.  We cannot extend additional therapy visits based on the contract we have between the group and EMI Health regardless of medical necessity.
