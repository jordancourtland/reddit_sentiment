Original Post: I got a bill in the mail for $471 that I got done March 18th and I just got the bill today (June 2nd). It says that the bill wasn't issued until May 23rd and I just got a new primary insurance about two weeks ago. The insurance that I had when I went to the doctor denied any coverage because I have a new primary insurance, but the diagnostics were ran two months ago?? What do I do about this? Also why are doctors bills so slow. Why did it take me two months to get this bill and why didn't insurance cover any of it before I even switched primary insurances
