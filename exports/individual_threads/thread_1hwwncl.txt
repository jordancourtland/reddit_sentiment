Original Post: Good afternoon hive mind! Several years ago (2022) my wife and I had health insurance through an employer and Cigna. Her doctor submitted a prior authorization request for Simponi Aria.  A medicine used to treat my wifeâ€™s rheumatoid arthritis. They approved the medication.  The doctor administered the medication.  They then submitted for payment from the insurance company who denied the claim.  Saying that even though it was approved via a prior authorization request it did not promise payment.  We have appealed and appealed etc. so has the doctors office.  Now we have been sent to collections for the 18k bill that should have been covered via insurance.  Does anyone have any guidance on how I can get them to cover the bill?
