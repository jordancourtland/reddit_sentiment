Fit Explanation: The original poster is actively seeking help with an ongoing denial, indicating a very good fit for assistance.
Original Post: My insurance, BCBS, started denying my psychiatry appointments (basic, monthly visits to adjust and review medication). I received an EOB stating that the service is not included in my plan, which is blatantly incorrect. The same insurance is currently covering my therapy appointments. My psychiatrist is in-network.

I appealed the decision, and am being told that the adjuster wants to see evidence of why I need medicine that my psychiatrist is perscribing to make a decision on my claim.

Does it seem normal that they are denying an included service and are now demanding to see evidence to support my need for medication on top of it all, which technically feels unrelated to my core claim that I am allowed this general service per my plan â€” regardless of my specific medication needs? I am extremely confused and hesitant on how to proceed.
