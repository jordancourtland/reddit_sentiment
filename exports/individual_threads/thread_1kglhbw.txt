Original Post: A while back, I went to urgent care for some nerve-related issues where I could hardly sleep at night because of the pain I was feeling. They did blood work and referred me for an MRI. They called my insurance and said it was approved, and I was told I’d only owe $300 based on my plan. Everything was in-network from the urgent care to the imaging center.

Now, weeks later, I just got hit with a $1500 bill. After receiving some letters, I found out the claim was denied because I didn’t go through my PCP for a referral. Since I’m a student, my PCP is through student health services of my college, but I was never aware I had to go through there first since it would take 3 weeks to get an appointment there. It’s why I went to urgent care because I needed to get it treated quickly. If I knew the claim wouldn’t go through I would have said no to the mri and just wait for the appointment! The urgent care doctor said it was necessary.

Im so very anxious and frustrated seeing this large bill that I could hardly afford. Not only that I haven’t even received my results from my MRI. I’m a college student who works part time and is considered low income.

Has anyone dealt with something like this? Any advice on getting this bill reduced or covered would help a lot. I just don’t know where to start and would appreciate any advice…
