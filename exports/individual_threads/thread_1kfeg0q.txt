Original Post: Tldr - insurance told me I was covered, I got treatment, now they are saying I wasn’t covered during the treatment dates due to their admin error. 

I was covered as a dependent spouse under my ex husband’s employer plan with UHC. He told me he would cancel my coverage when we got divorced, but on my end I kept checking coverage and he still hadn’t canceled it, so I had some medical appointments and procedures. I contacted him to ask him about his plans to cancel the insurance and he said he already had. Apparently there was some administrative error, and they mistakenly thought I was still covered. Now they have backdated my coverage end date to last November and denied all of the recent claims.

I never received any COBRA information, and I was very careful about checking coverage before I scheduled my appointments. I plan to reach out to them ASAP, but I want to understand my rights and protections first. I obviously never would have gotten procedures and appointments without insurance, and I’m pretty sure that I’m not going to be able to get a new plan to retroactively cover this. 

Please help!
