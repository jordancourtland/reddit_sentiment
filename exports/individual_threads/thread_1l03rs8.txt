Fit Explanation: The original poster is actively dealing with a denial and may need assistance navigating the appeal process, indicating a very good fit.
Original Post: I have been through the wringer with UHC denying a MRI my Neurologist ordered. I have completed an appeal and so has my doctor. They denied service. During the appeal process, my company changed health insurance companies to Anthem, so as of midnight tonight, I will no longer have UHC. 
I am wondering, has anyone heard of UHC denying service because they were running the clock? I'm in Virginia. I feel that it is criminal how they denied me physical therapy last fall,  so I paid out of pocket. I'm an underwriter for Title insurance and usually, I can  speak with someone and we figure out why I am not getting my coverage. UHC continually denied me any resolution. I could never speak with someone after escalating the claim. The phone tree never got me anywhere nor did their text option in the app.
