Original Post: I had surgery for a deviated septum and sinus issues on 5/26/23. I have Medicaid and the surgery was pre approved and I was told there would zero out of pocket cost. My insurance paid the bill in full on 6/20/23. The office I went to is saying they’ve billed the insurance 5 times and they won’t cover it and that the bill is my responsibility. I have the claim number from my insurance with the bill paid in full and I gave it to the office and they told me they’ll resubmit for payment with that claim number but they have nothing in their system saying its paid. I told her insurance paid it on June 20th and the to contact my insurance with the claim number and to stop sending me bills for the surgery when it was paid and she hung up. Upon reading reviews other people have had this issue with them. Anything I can do?
