Original Post: I had an appointment with Lifestance in October of last year and they incorrectly billed my previous insurance policy, and of course the claim was denied. They did not inform me of this, and I found out about it a few months later though the portal (probably should have looked sooner, I know but I've never had a denied claim before). Prior to the appointment, I uploaded my insurance info via the patient portal as their call line specifically states "Please visit your patient portal to update your insurance information." When I called to correct the issue, they blamed me for not calling them with my new insurance info. Anyway, they bill my new plan and I specially told them to bill Magellan as that is the carve out for mental health insurance through my health plan. They didn't do this and billed my new medical plan twice and got denied and again they didn't tell me. I had to call them in order to find out. Now Magellan is saying the grace period is over as it has been over 90 days and the claim will likely be denied. Fair, but I refuse to pay the bill as this was Lifestance's screw up. Magellan told me that I will need to seek an appeal through Lifestance. Has anyone had this experience before? Is there a way that I hold Lifestance accountable or get the bill cancelled?
