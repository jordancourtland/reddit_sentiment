Original Post: I changed jobs and got a new policy.  I informed my doctors office of the change and they said they did indeed take my new insurance.  I even asked again the day of the appointment just to be sure...  I was assured they did so I went ahead with the appointment., a simple physical (i didnt even do the blood work portion). And now I have a notice saying that my claim was denied and now I owe $2000+ for my physical.  If it matters, the insurance is Health Net and the notice if from Astrana Health
