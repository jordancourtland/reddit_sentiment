Original Post: I despise medical coverage and how piss poor it is in the US.

My employers best insurance plan is a $4k deductible and an $8k max out of pocket...so every time I go to the doctor they charge me $80 because I have not met my deductible, then send me a bill for the remaining balance.   
  
I was recently suspected to have sleep apnea, so it was one office visit for me to tell them what I was experiencing, then another office visit to speak with a sleep specialist and tell them the same thing, now I have another visit to pick up a medical device to do an at home sleep study, another visit to drop off that device, and then a visit to discuss the results, and after that I am guessing I will have treatment and follow up visits...Note each time I walk in the doctors door they are taking $80 from me, automatically!  Some of these visits are 5 minutes!   
  
I was told I have to try traditional CPAP machine, then alternative devices, then we could look at medication, and as a final hoop to jump through insurance may allow surgery! Since when does an insurance company get the right to deny or approve coverage over a DOCTTOR.MEDICAL professional?!  
  
Also, I have high blood pressure and weight issues, but can't afford to address those right now. 

Any tips or tricks to save money and get the treatment I need? Seriously...out of pocket payers get better rates and care than those with insurance! For example, say the doctors office says their office visits are $125, but insurance says they can charge up to $420...because I have insurance and have not met my deductible, I have to pay $420, where as Joe Smith off the street with no insurance gets to pay $125. That is WRONG. But, if I don't have health insurance, the government also fines me at tax time. 

/end rant. But seriously any tips?
