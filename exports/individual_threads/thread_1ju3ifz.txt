Original Post: Hi everyone,
My family is relocating and my family will have a 90 window before my husband's insurance kicks in. We have gotten all of our check ups done recently and really just need piece of mind if an accident happens. 

My COBRA amount would be insane so I have been shopping short term plans, but I know coverage is pretty limited. 

My question is: If we're on a short term health plan and something terrible happens that isn't covered, am I able to then elect COBRA as long as its within the 60 days that COBRA gives you? Or would COBRA deny me because I have other insurance?
