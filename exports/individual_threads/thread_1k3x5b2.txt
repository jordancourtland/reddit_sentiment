Original Post: Hello! I'm a 24 year old woman totally new to medical insurance coverage and trying to manage my healthcare for the first time.

I recently visited an in-network OBGYN for the first time and was billed **$1500**. This was a 45-60 minute office visit with verbal discussion of menstrual cycle, breast tissue exam, and some preventative testing (Gonorrhea test, Syphilis test, and PAP Smear).

I was billed for the following (referring to my EOB, these are the final "allowed amounts", and I did receive the equivalent bill from the doctor's office)

\- Office/Outpatient New High Mdm 60 Minutes - 99205 (CPT), Prolong outpt/office vis - G2212 (HCPCS) = **$900** (\*\*Plan covered $0, all goes to my deductible). $900 is the allowed amount, the original amount was $940.  
\- HC Neisseria Gonor Amp Probe Naat - 87591 (CPT), HC Chl Trach Amp Probe Naat - 87491 (CPT), HC Labvagpcr - 81515 (CPT®) = **$600** (\*\*Plan covered $0, all goes to my deductible) $600 is the total allowed amount, the original amount was $1300.

I had no idea that this visit would cost so much and can't afford to pay it. All the items listed above, I considered regular check-up items that would fall under preventative care.

I talked to UHC on the phone and they said that the visit would only not go towards my deductible if it was considered my Preventative Yearly Visit. 

When I scheduled the appointment with the OBGYN office, they didn't ask whether this would be a preventative yearly visit or not. When they asked if I had any concerns, I mentioned that I'd been dealing with irregular menstrual cycles for about a year. *Did my admittance of irregular menstrual cycles result in the office not considering my visit to be preventative?*

What can I do at this point to try to lower my bill?

* For the $900 in-office (in-network) visit -&gt; Does anyone have any advice for calling the doctor’s office and trying to convince them to bill it as my preventative yearly visit? 
* For the $600 lab testing -&gt; Why are these not considered preventative? According to UHC guidelines for my age range, the Pap smear and the STD testing should be...

My deductible is $3,300.  
Any and all advice would be much appreciated!! I've been freaking out, I don't know how I screwed up this badly on my first OBGYN visit ever. Thank you in advance!
