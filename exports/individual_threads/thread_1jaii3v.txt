Original Post: I'm really frustrated here. I have a list of bloodwork that need to get done (7) and I'm trying to find out before I get it done if it will be covered by insurance or not. PCP provided codes and I gave those over the phone to the insurance company. 

They were unable to find the codes on the system and their only answer was: you will be covered as long as the provider can proof that these tests are truly necessary. I've heard stories about insurance denying coverage because they don't think it was medically necessary and seriously can't afford to uncovered testing. This system is nuts.
