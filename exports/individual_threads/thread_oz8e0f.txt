Original Post: Thank you in advance for taking the time to read this— I could really use some advice. Nearly two years ago, October of 2019,  I had a medical procedure done for which I had complete insurance coverage, as long as pre-approval was obtained. On two occasions before the procedure, I was told  by the clinic that everything was in order, and I owed nothing more than copay. I was told the same thing on two follow up visits within a month after the procedure. In December of that year, I received a bill for the full amount of the procedure. I called the billing department and was told that was an error, and to disregard. I heard nothing more.   


In May of 2021, I received a bill for a slightly discounted amount for the procedure from 10/19. I immediately called the billing department, who told me to contact my former insurance company (CareFirst/BCBS). When I spoke to CareFirst, they told me that the clinic had never requested pre-approval, so the claim was denied. And what’s worse, the clinic waited over 12 months to file an appeal when the window was 180 days, so there was no chance at all of getting coverage. The agent at CareFirst repeatedly referred to this as “billing negligence“ and said that her advice was to call the clinic and confront them as she personally didn’t believe I should be held responsible for their repeated mistakes. I did call, and the clinic billing person seemed nervous, at which point they said they would resubmit to insurance, who I already knew would never pay this bill. Well, low and behold, I have received another bill from the clinic.

In the time this has been going on, I have done some deep dives into the clinic, and billing issues and negligence seems to be par for the course at this particular location. I understand that I probably should have confirmed that pre-approval was granted, but this was only a couple of months after my father had died— very suddenly and very traumatically, and I just wasn‘t all together “there”, plus I trusted the clinic as I had been seeing them for two years prior with no issues at all. My husband has  JUST gone back to work and I am still mostly unemployed due to Covid related job loss and we can’t pay this bill right now. Not to mention how livid I am over the fact that I was completely and totally covered for this. Can anyone advise me as to what my options might be?
