Original Post: Hello, I have a provider service from 4/2/24 that was $1,100. It was a fertility service where $600 was covered and my insurance denied coverage for the other $500 of the bill (as per the EOB). That’s totally fine, we knew this would happen for some bills. When I log into MyChart (for the provider), I can see where this service is still “pending insurance” for the other $500…. And now we are more than a year later and I’m wondering how long do they have to actually send me a bill for the $500? I do owe it, and my insurance has already done everything on their end. I’m in PA and my insurance is Aetna if that matters.
