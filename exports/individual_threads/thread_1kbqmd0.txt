Original Post: I'm posting for my mother in law who just received a statement from her late husband's FSA, denying several claims from 2020. It states they have voided the check for this. 

I'm assuming that either the company that was originally paid will be contacting us for payment? Or, given that he is deceased for 4 years and the date of service was 5 years ago, it will be written off? 

I'll likely call them for more info tomorrow when they open, but she's pretty freaked out by this right now.
