Original Post: Hello,

I have Cigna health insurance, and also work in the healthcare industry. I am the type to scour an insurance plan prior to signing up and typically know the ins and outs of what is covered versus what is not. 

I recently had a preventive care visit, where routine labs were completed. One of these labs was denied by my insurance due to frequency. I was confused by this because it had been over a year since I last had this preventive test done, and from my understanding of my policy this testing was covered on an annual basis. 

I went to the support chat for Cigna, and the representative stated they changed the coverage of this test to every 3 years on March 17th of this year, a few weeks before my testing was performed. 

I did not receive any kind of notice from Cigna detailing this mid-year change in coverage, and there was no mention of it in their “Annual Notification of Change” for 2025 that is specific to my plan. The representative I was chatting with stated they only changed it within the Preventive Care PDF online.

Is this allowable or do I have a leg to stand on to appeal the coverage? It feels shady to change coverage in the middle of a plan year and not explicitly send out notification of the change.
