Original Post: Boyfriend(31M) has (MA)BlueCBS and went in for a new patient intake appointment at a practice that the insurance covered with a PCP the insurance covered. During the visit he was told he was obese. 

He recently got his bill in the mail for it and was charged $300 despite having full coverage.

When he called the PCP office they were shocked he was denied and helped him file a dispute. Just found out today that it was because he got an obesity diagnosis. Everything I'm researching is saying that the ACA prevents claim denial based on weight.

This isn't allowed, right? He didn't go in for screening, a diagnosis, a problem, etc. He didn't have any tests or blood work. This was a standard 30min intake appointment.

Edit: I appreciate all the advice and information everyone has given. I know this hasn't been the most clear inquiry as I don't have his EOB and a lot of the info I have is second hand (and through the lens of bf's frustration). I do apologize, still, going through what everyone has said so far has given a starting point. A lot of this is new to me as well and I appreciate the input very much. I'll be sure to update this with "Solved" and an explanation once it's figured out.
