Original Post: Hello. 

I’m looking for options or ideas to fight the denial. I’ll start by saying I’m not medical insurance savvy whatsoever, I struggle to fully understand the what’s and whatnots. Her insurance is Christis Health Plan. 

My mother (45) battled stage 3 cancer last year up until two months ago when we finally got the good news she’s in remission. As she’s come off an aggressive treatment plan, she has started to lose function of her legs. Her PCP has ordered an MRI to attempt to diagnose but the insurance has denied it. Currently she’s on a medication to ease the numbness/ loss of control but over the last few weeks it has gotten to the point she cant make it up the four stairs without help and falls on uneven ground. I’m not sure how much else info is relevant but I’ll do my best to answer any questions. 

She’s calling both her doctor and insurance in the morning for further information. What specifically should she be asking? Is there anything we can do to help get this approved? Any help is so appreciated as a $1400 MRI cash pay seems daunting, much less whatever it may cost to get her back in walking order.
