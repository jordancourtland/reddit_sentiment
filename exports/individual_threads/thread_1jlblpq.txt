Original Post: I am in Missouri, 27 years old,  and it's very hard to get anything medicaid related done here, so I need to be able to be my own advocate when I go into the dss office in the morning. So if anyone can help me figure out what needs to be done here I would greatly appreciate it!!!

I was laid off Oct 3, 2024. I earned 23,367 gross that year according to my W2. I decided to go back to school instead of getting a new job immediately. My understanding was this made me ineligible for MO medicaid until Jan 1 since my income for 2024 was over the limit. I was deemed eligible for a marketplace plan with subsidy from Dec 1- 31 and I did use that. They recently finally approved my medicaid application after months two days ago, and backdated it to Nov 1. I began the process of having my 2025 medical costs I paid on a credit card rebilled to medicaid after I was approved. But because it is backdated to November 1, I now have a coverage overlap in December with my marketplace plan that is causing the rebilling to be denied due to coverage overlap. How does this get resolved? Will I have to pay back my subsidy? 

Mini rant: It's all very confusing and the hold times for dss in missouri usually pass 4 hours before this time of afternoon. (I've been kicked off the phone on hold because it went past closing time before, over 4 hours hold) so my plan is to go to the office tomorrow or Monday before they open so I can get a spot to be seen within 2 hours by the people that know what they're doing. But I'd like to know what needs to happen so I can make sure this gets resolved because I'm about tired of all this to say the least.  

I appreciate any advice from the bottom of my heart, this is very stressful for me.
