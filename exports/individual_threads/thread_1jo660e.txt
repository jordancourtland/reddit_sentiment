Original Post: Long story short.. for 10 years my spouse and I have been going through the Marketplace to get our Health Insurance on a group plan.  For some unknown reason, the Marketplace split our plan into tow separate policies.  Both premiums were paid for the month of January.  My autopay was "passively" applied to my account but they did not apply auto pay to my spouse's policy.  Assuming (I know) that all was in place, I didn't check on payments.  His policy was cancelled due to non-payment on Feb 1.  The only reason we found out, is his surgery on 2/27 was denied coverage.   

Blue Cross has agreed to reinstate his policy HOWEVER the Marketplace is denying reinstatement !  We are in an appeals process but have no idea how to approach this,  Anyone else been in a similar situation?
