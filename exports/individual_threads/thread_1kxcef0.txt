Fit Explanation: The original poster is facing a denial situation and is seeking advice on future coverage options, indicating a very good fit for the persona.
Original Post: I was prescribed Mounjaro through Aetna (my employerâ€™s insurance) since i was classified as pre-diabetic. I just got laid off and my insurance coverage will end June 30. I have been on Mounjaro for a year and a half, and I am now healthier. What are the chances another insurance carrier will deny me Mounjaro now that my AC1 levels are normal? Or will they see that I have been taking it regularly and approve me?
