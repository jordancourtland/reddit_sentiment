Original Post: My FIL passed on August 15, 2024. I haven't looked at his health insurance portal since I told the insurance company he died, but his accountant needed me to download a document, so I just logged in. The doctor at his long-term care facility filed claims for 99310 four times after he died (once on August 25, and three times in September). I looked up 99310, and it's listed as subsequent nursing facility care with a high level of medical decision making and a comprehensive history and exam.

I don't know a lot about coding, so before I call and ask why they would be billing for these issues when their patient was not alive, I wanted to ask here if there's any legitimate reason this would happen. If the doctor needed to review his records after he died, I would imagine they would use a different code than one that is supposed to be about hands-on care. But I wanted to check first.

The facility made a medication error that ended up killing him, so I don't want to call there if I don't absolutely have to. The insurance denied three of the claims, but it paid $148 for one of them. If it's not legit, I want to contact the insurance and let them know (I'm an executor of his estate, so I'm obligated to handle all the financial stuff).
