Original Post: I've been very sick for 3 years and have a tight grip on my insurance coverage, and although it's a lot of work I've always found solutions. Now comes 2025 where my employer changed its' longstanding plan, and I have faced nonstop denials I don't know how to navigate. As employees we were told that since this is a self-funded/self-written plan, they only brought on this plan given it's minimally equal to but should be better than previous coverage. I don't have direct contact with my insurance company-- all communications have to go through Included Health, so I have to direct a team of people on what I want done. It's a mess, but looking for advice on the below denials:

**Physical therapy prior auth denial**: I go through 25 PT visits about every 4 months. Previous insurance approved 25 at a time, no problem for every re-up on prior auths. On this prior auth they approved 25 visits on the phone to my PT auth team, but then only sent approval for 3 visits and at home care instructions. They are holding firm, won't get on the phone with my PT office, etc.. We know it's a planned denial, but since it was an approval *just* given, we're waiting on the next denial. Nowhere does my plan state that there's a physical therapy cap, and I need advice on how to hold them to this self-written/self-funded plan plus the fact they verbally approved 25 visits. I have flagged this to my HR team, caused a stink with Included Health, etc. but I'm concerned nothing is moving the needle.

**Botox prior auth denial:** I've been on botox administered by my neuro for 3 years. My pharm coverage has remained the same (CVS Caremark), but suddenly botox denied with no rationale. The neuro office didn't want to do a letter of medical necessity, peer to peer or anything else. I'm planning on making them, but is there anything else I can/should do?

**Xolair prior auth denial**: My immunologist is working quite well on this since he administered 2 shots of others meds...

**Mestinon prior auth denial**: The dosing I need is 30mg. CVS denied prior auth for 30mg 3x, then once the peer to peer came they said they will only approve 60mg, but 60mg is way too much for me as I'm even starting on 15mg and I can't break up the pills. How do I get the lower dose approved?

I'm beside myself that I'm losing access to all the care that gives me the smallest quality of life I have left, and it all came crashing down within the same week.
