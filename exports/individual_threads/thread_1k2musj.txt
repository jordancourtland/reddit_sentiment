Original Post: I am 21 I live in Texas and I make about 18,000-20,000/year.
(I have never had insurance before, and I don’t have anyone to really help me out with this, so I apologize if this is a silly question).

I was paying my insurance monthly payment (I have UHC through the market place) and I noticed I had some claims that didn’t look right. One i was denied for $60 and they said I owed, but when I looked at the pdf it said I owed $0?? (Weird!)

The main thing I am very confused about is my UHC says I have spent $71.82/150 for my deductible. I didn’t realize were these numbers were coming from till I looked at my claims ($71.82 is how much I owe on blood work, even though UHC says they cover it…I will call the doctor on Monday to see if that’s an accurate number.)

Anyways, I have not paid the $71.82 and I do not know why my deductible reflects that when I haven’t paid it. Will the number go back up if the price gets reduced or does my account think I paid? (I haven’t gotten a bill from anyone, I legit only noticed I owed people when I looked at my claims for fun. It’s over a month old.) Thank you!

TLDR: I owe money on a claim that I haven’t paid, but my deductible reflects that I paid it. Is that normal?
