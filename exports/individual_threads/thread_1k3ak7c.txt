Original Post: Hi! Im 26F. We just moved to New Hampshire and no longer qualify for marketplace coverage. We just enrolled in my husband's employer insurance (Cigna) which covers pretty much nothing until our $4500 deductible is met, including prescriptions. However, we just received Caremark prescription cards in the mail and I'm confused on how they work. 

Situation: my doctor prescribed Mounjaro for type 2 diabetes, and it is completely unaffordable at $1200/month. The prescription card says i would pay $100/month pending prior authorization. What does this mean? Will it be denied coverage still until the deductible is met, or is the prescription card meant to be used immediately? 

While we are here, what is prior authorization in children's terms, because I feel like i just can not comprehend any of this lol. Thank you in advance :)
