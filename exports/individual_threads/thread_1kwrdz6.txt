Original Post: We are both on my wife's insurance through her job, but the job/coverage ends on June 30.  She starts her new job July 1st and would be eligible for their plan, but the coverage is much worse.  We have some large expenses coming up in July that we'd need COBRA for because the new plan wouldn't cover it at all.  But we're hoping not to have to pay for COBRA for the rest of the year, just 1 month or maybe 2 if possible. As long as we sign up for marketplace insurance within the 60 day period of the loss of employer-sponsored coverage, can we do this outside of the open enrollment period and then drop COBRA after 1 month? Or would they know we signed up for COBRA and deny us from marketplace insurance even within the 60 day period?
