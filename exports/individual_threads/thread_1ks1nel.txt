Original Post: Basically Posting for advice. In Virginia on an Anthem plan through my dad's Union, My Mom has a chronic illness, That leads to frequent hospital visits. So Far the hospital is saying they owe 70k, and they've told me they will not accept a payment of anything less than 1/12th of the total balance, which is obviously impossible. Even the finance/billing department of the hospital told me to just keep applying for financial assistance. (rejected 3 times) 

I've looked over my dad's insurance and it says there is no out of pocket max, which is insane to me. Is that even legal?

Either way, I started to look at the claims themselves and found they've been denying a huge chunk of bills for at least the past 6 months. It looks to be roughly 20 kicked back for this code:

Most of the denials are for "ancillary Services" or "Emergency Dept Visit Mod Mdm"

Does this mean the hospital has been billing things incorrectly? Where should I go from here? 

I appreciate any help!
