Original Post: I have Aetna with acupuncture coverage. I had seen a provider 6 times, 3 times in 2023 and 3 times in 2024. All of the visits were coded CPT Code 97811 and CPT Code 97810. In 2024, I saw the provider in January, June, and July. For some reason, the visit in June was denied and Aetna said it was experimental. But the provider billed using the exact same code as before and after June 2024. All other claims had been paid.

I'm at a stage of appealing this decision. But I'm wondering if anyone has any insights into why a claim would randomly be deemed experimental when it was paid as normal otherwise?
