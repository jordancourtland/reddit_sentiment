Fit Explanation: The original poster is currently dealing with a claim denial and seeking clarification, indicating a very good fit for needing appeal help soon.
Original Post: This is for blood work I had done a few weeks ago at a local hospital lab. I have Anthem BC/BS for my insurance.

A claim was submitted and I paid the bill for $44.85 around two weeks ago.

However, I just got a notification saying the claim was resubmitted and denied. Then a new claim saying I owe $73.79. However, when I look at the EOB it says $44.85.

Does this mean I will owe another $73, or just owe the difference between the two? ($28.94). 

This is the first time Iâ€™ve seen something like this. Why was the claim resubmitted in the first place?
