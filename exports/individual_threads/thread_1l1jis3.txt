Fit Explanation: The original poster is currently dealing with a denial and is actively seeking help to resolve the issue, indicating a very good fit.
Original Post: I had a colonoscopy that should have been fully covered by my insurance as a preventive service. However, the gastroenterology practice billed it using the wrong code, and my insurance denied the claim.

I called my insurance company, and they confirmed that the denial was due to the incorrect billing code. While I was still on the line, they contacted the gastroenterology billing office and explained that if the correct code was submitted, the procedure would be covered in full. The billing office agreed to correct and resubmit the claim.

Unfortunately, they failed to follow through in a timely manner. By the time they finally submitted the corrected bill, it was past the deadline, and my insurance company refused to process the payment due to the delay. They stated that the provider had not fulfilled their responsibility in time.

Now, the gastroenterology practice has sent the bill to collections, even though I don't believe I should be held responsible for an error on their part. I'm not sure how to resolve this. Any suggestions?
