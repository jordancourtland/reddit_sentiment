Original Post: i had an psychiatry appointment in September for medication management. i go to JPS which does provider based billing so their is always 2 claims from the hospital and one from the provider I have already gone twice for the same appointment in 2024 and they have been fully covered and I pay a $10 copay. My third appointment in September one claim (the hospital claim) was denied and my providers claim was approved but I have to pay the full amount of $200. i filed an appeal but they only fixed one claim the hospital bill that was denied ( I do not have to pay) but for the provider bill I have been calling and they say it will be reworked but then there is nothing. i have been going back and forth for a month now. They are now saying the rework is denied and I must pay the full amount of $200 what do I do?
