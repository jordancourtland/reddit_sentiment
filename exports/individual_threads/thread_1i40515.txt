Original Post: I had what felt like a stroke which required a medical transport and two night hospital stay with an mri and ultrasound. Unfortunately I didn't understand that just paying for health insurance does not make it active and I was over two weeks from the effective date. My insurance has already denied the claim twice after submitting a grievance: is there any point in trying to appeal again with my insurance provider? Ive also continuously forgotten to deal with this so the original bill has now been sent to collections. Can I bring it back to the original hospital in anyway? I feel so fucking stupid.

  
Edit: I meant ER not Urgent Care
