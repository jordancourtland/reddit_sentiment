Fit Explanation: The original poster has a denial and is looking for help, indicating a very good fit for the persona.
Original Post: For some reason my insurance denied coverage of this code, which when I looked it up is a new patient preventative procedure- basically a physical.  This was from last year. 

This seems obscene, what are my options?  

I read that Biden enacted a law where outstanding medical debt cannot affect your credit score, so how else could this potentially affect me?
